### [Montagu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Montagu)-[Chelmsford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Thesiger,_1st_Viscount_Chelmsford) Report and the Government of India Act, 1919

- The principle of **Dyarchy**(dual government) was introduced according to which the executive branch was divided into:
	- Authoritarian section: consisting of executive councillors , appointed by the crown
	- Popularly respocible section: consisting of MInisters chosen by the Governor from among the elected members.
- Elected members in Legislative Councils increased to 70%
- **Devolution of Power:**The subjects were divided into Provisional and Central
	- The provisional subjects were further divided into:
		- _"transferred"_ to be administered by the provisional Governor with aid and advice of a Council of Ministers responsible to the Legislature
		- _"reserved"_- to be administered by the Governor without responsibility to the Legislature
	- Provisional budgets , seperate from the GOI, empowering the Provisional legislature to present its own budget and levy its own taxes as per its own sources of revenue
	- However, this is not a federal distribution of power, as the power is by definition delegated tot he Province by the centre, and the fact that a law ascented to by the Governor of a province would not become law, unless also ascented to by the Governor General of India
- **The Indian Legislature made more representative ** by
	- Introduction of **bicameralism** consisting of 
		- a Legislative Assembly
		- a Council of States
	- However , overriding powers still remained with the Governor-General such as:
		- The power to veto a bill
		- Prior sanction requirement for bills on certain subjects
		- Ordinance (temporary) making power in case of emergency

#### Shortcomings
1. It was on the Governor-General to decide whether a subject was Central or Provisional and not the Courts
2. In the provinces, most executive power was consolidated in the Governor as finance was a reserved subject
