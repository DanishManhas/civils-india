An offence under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, cannot be presumed to be committed in every crime where the victim happens to be an SC or ST, the High Court of Karnataka has said.

The court also pointed out that if the motive for crime is not caste-based attack or hatred towards that caste, the accused can only be chargesheeted for any of the offences under the Indian Penal Code that can be appropriately invoked in the background of the incident of crime or under other laws that can be applied as the facts and circumstances indicate.

**‘Decide wisely’**

Though the Act is essentially meant for protecting members of the SC and ST communities from atrocity or oppression, it cannot be allowed to be misused; and therefore, the court said, there is a greater responsibility on the investigating officer to take the decision wisely before filing the chargesheet. Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar passed the order while quashing the criminal proceedings initiated against one Lokanath, a resident of the city.
