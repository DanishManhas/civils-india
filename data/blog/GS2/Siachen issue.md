# Issue of Siachen

![[The-boundaries-of-Kashmir.png]]
## Introduction
- Known as third pole
- source of important rivers Nubra and Shyok
- World's highest battlefield
- Since **Operation Meghdooth**, the strategic heights of the glacier are under India's control
## Origin of the Issue
- Not clearly demarcated during the [[Shimla Agreement]] for being uninhabitable anyway
- The LOC was demarcated upto the point **NJ9842**.
- Beyond this point, the LOC officially moves **northward**.
- Pakistan contends that the northward means north East wards up to Karakorum Pass such that Siachin becomes part of Pakistani controlled territory
- India emphasises that the LOC moves northwestwards such that Siachen becomes part of Indian controlled territory.
## The stakes
- Adverse impact on fragile ecology of Siachen
- More soldiers succumb to extreme cold each year than to bullets
- High expenditure incurred for maintenance of forces.
- Stephen P Cohen, a prominent expert on South Asian security — while dismissing the geographical importance of Siachen in a military context — once described the standoff between India and Pakistan in Siachen as “a struggle of two bald men over a comb.”
## Suggested Solutions
1. Both sides agree on the necessity of demilitarization. The dispute lies in the order of steps to be taken. India insists on delineation, demarcation and then demilitarization.
2. Manmohan Singh had proposed to convert the glacier into "a mountain of peace" and for both countries to conduct scientific research on it
