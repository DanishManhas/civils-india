 It's a set of 5 principles to guide the conduct of India's relations with immediate neighbours (formulated in 1996)
 1. With neighbours like Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Maldives, India **will not ask for reciprocity** and give whatever it can in good faith and trust.
 2. No South Asian country will allow the use of its territory against the interest of any other in the region
 3. Non-interference in domestic affairs
 4. All South Asian countries will respect each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
 5. Settle all disputes through peaceful bilateral negotiations.
