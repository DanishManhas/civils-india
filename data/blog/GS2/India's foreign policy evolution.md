# 1942 - 62 (Phase 1)
#non-alignment #NAM
### NON ALIGNMENT 
rooted in
- India's civilizational values of peace and non-violence
-  A legacy of colonization and values which guided Indian National Movement
-  Practical considerations of limiting military expenditure and utilizing the limited economic resources of the country for development of the nation
#### Purpose of non-alignment policy
1. to escape the entrapment of Cold War politics between the USA led NATO and USSR led WARSAW countries
2. to be able to judge issues based on their merit and not being forced to take a particular stand based on being a member of any bloc. IN fact, Indian policymakers made a strong effort to **distinguish policy of non-alignment from neutralism**
### Other characteristic features of the phase
1. India played a key role in multilateral institutions
	- A prominent contributor to UN peace keeping missions
	- supported peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict
2. Champion of disarmament.
	- India pioneered the **partial test ban treaty** for testing of nuclear weapons
3.  Being a critical leader of NAM, India supported decolonization and anti-apartheid through it.

# 1962 -90(Phase 2)
**Age of self-help**. Because of the humiliating defeat at the hands of China, India realized the need for defense preparedness.
Following the civil war in East Pakistan, an influx of large number of refugees in India made it realize the need for its involvement to seek dismemberment of Pakistan. Consequently, it signed the treaty of peace, friendship and cooperation with USSR and with its military involvement, created Bangladesh. It thus emerged as the undisputed leader of South Asia. However, its regional ascendance was not marked with global ascendance in power hierarchies
### Reason
1. Weak economy of India, stuck in the "Hindu Growth Rate".
2. In the aftermath of Chinese nuclear test in 1964, India conducted [[subterranean nuclear explosion]], referred to as India's peaceful nuclear explosion, [[Operation Smiling Buddha]] in May 1974. India, as a consequence, faced global condemnation and significant economic and technological sanctions. Thus, Indian policymakers chose not to carry out any further nuclear tests

# 1990 onwards(Phase of pragmatic foreign policy)
## Cold War onwards
### Disintegration of USSR --> India pursues good relations with the USA.
With the disintegration of USSR emerge a unipolar world order with the USA as a single superpower. India lost its most trusted ally and now sought to improve relations with long estranged USA. 
	However, the goal was not met until the **two years of negotiations between India's then external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha and USA's assistant Secreatary of State Strobe Talbott**
### Economic liberalization
Following the BOP crisis, India adopted new economic policy under IMF's structural adjustment program. As a consequence, India did away with its export pessimism, liberated its economy and consequently witnessed considerable rise in GDP growth
### Foreign policy change --> Concentric circles approach, Look East, Ambassadorial relations with Israel
At the political level, the then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao came out with the concentric circles approach to foreign policy. It sought to improve India's relationship with its extended neighborhood.
- In case of West Asia, India upgraded its diplomatic relations with Israel to the ambassadorial level. India, for the first time, was able to balance the three pillars of West Asian politics, i.e., Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia.
- India launched look East policy in the context of its South East Asian neighbours.
	Reasons:
	1. Because of economic liberalization, India was in search of new markets
	2. search for new partners after the loss of its most trusted ally (therefore, look East policy had a strategic dimension)
### Crossing the nuclear Rubicon
India conducted operation Shakti and test its nuclear weapons to become a de facto nuclear state.
#### Reasons
1. Long term security threat from China. 
2. Indian pressure was building on India because of successful indefinite extension of nuclear [[non proliferation treaty]](NPT) in 1995 and efforts at early conclusion of the [[Comprehensive Test Ban treaty]] (CTBT). This made Indian policymakers exercise the nuclear option in the form of operation Shakti.
#### International Response
- Tough sanctions by the USA and other major powers.
- NSG was created directly in response to Pokhran II.
- However, strong economic growth, large size of Indian market and India's self-imposed moratorium on future nuclear tests attracted the world powers towards India
## In more recent years:
1. 1991 onwards, there's been a steady acceptance of the role of material power in international politics. The concrete decision to link India's foreign policy to achieve the county's economic objectives has been the characteristic feature of both the UPA and the NDA regime governments
2. To pursue strategic autonomy in the age of complex interdependence, India is following the policy of multiple engagements. It has strategic partnerships with more than 30 countries. Today, India has close relations not only with the USA and Japan, but also with Russia and China ([[NAM 2.0]]).
3. In recent years, India's immediate neighborhood South Asia and the Indian Ocean region has come to acquire greater prominence in India's foreign policy as evident in [[Neighbourhood First Policy]] of the current government.
