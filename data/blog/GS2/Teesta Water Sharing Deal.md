PM while on his tour of Bangladesh assured his best to ink the long-awaited deal over the Teesta and other common rivers. On at least two occasions—2011 and 2017—Bangladesh and India came close to signing a deal on the Teesta.

#### Teesta River

-   Teesta River is a 315 km long river that rises in the eastern Himalayas, flows through the Indian states of Sikkim and West Bengal through Bangladesh and enters the Bay of Bengal.
-   It is a tributary of the Brahmaputra (known as Jamuna in Bangladesh), flowing through India and Bangladesh.
-   It originates in the Himalayas near Chunthang, Sikkim and flows to the south through West Bengal before entering Bangladesh.
-   Originally, it continued southward to empty directly into the Padma River but around 1787 the river changed its course to flow eastward to join the Jamuna river.
-   The Teesta Barrage dam helps to provide irrigation for the plains between the upper Padma and the Jamuna.

#### What is the dispute about?

-   The point of contention between India and Bangladesh is mainly the lean season flow in the Teesta draining into Bangladesh.
-   The river covers nearly the entire floodplains of Sikkim while draining 2,800 sq km of Bangladesh, governing the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
-   For West Bengal, Teesta is equally important, considered the lifeline of half-a-dozen districts in North Bengal.
-   Bangladesh has sought an “equitable” distribution of Teesta waters from India, on the lines of the Ganga Water Treaty of 1996, but to no avail.
-   The failure to ink a deal had its fallout on the country’s politics, putting the ruling party of PM Sheikh Hasina in a spot.

#### The deal

-   Following a half-hearted deal in 1983, when a nearly equal division of water was proposed, the countries hit a roadblock. The transient agreement could not be implemented.
- IN 1984, India bangladesh entered an ad hoc agreement making provisions for sharing 75% of the river water. India's share being 39% and 36% for Bangladesh.
- Bangladesh wants equiable sharing.
- It want the remaining 25% water to be equally divided between the two countries.
-   Talks resumed after the Awami League returned to power in 2008 and the former Indian PM Manmohan Singh visited Dhaka in 2011.
-   In 2015, PM Modi’s visit to Dhaka generated more ebullient lines: deliberations were underway involving all the stakeholders to conclude the agreement as soon as possible.

#### Issues from the Indian side

-   It remains an unfinished project and one of the key stakeholders — West Bengal CM is yet to endorse the deal.
-   Her objection is connected to “global warming. Many of the glaciers on the Teesta basin have retreated.
-   The importance of the flow and the seasonal variation of this river is felt during the lean season (from October to April/May) as the average flow is about 500 million cubic metres (MCM) per month.
-   The CM opposed an arrangement in 2011, by which India would get 42.5% and Bangladesh 37.5% of the water during the lean season, and the plan was shelved.

#### Why does it matter?

-   India witnessed a surge in the insurgency in the northeast during the rule of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) from 2001 to 2005.
-   Bangladesh allegedly sheltered insurgents engaged in anti-India activities, and nearly all the Home Ministry-level talks ended without agreement, and India had to increase the security budget for the northeast.
-   In a couple of years of assuming office in 2008, the Awami League targeted insurgent camps and handed over the rebels to India.
-   As India’s security establishment heaved a sigh of relief, the relationship improved on multiple fronts.


## Way forward
- Since Bangladesh's demand is based on genuine need, India should accomodate it as per the [[Gujral Doctrine]] as a  benevolent big brother.
- In return for equitable sharing, India can bargain for comprehensive [[Permanant Transit Agreement]] with Bangladesh which is essential for development of India's INR
