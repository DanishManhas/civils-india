### IORA leaders summit 2017, in Jakarata indonesia
- For the first time, IORA organised a meeting of the heads of state of its member countries
- It concluded with the signing of the IORA concord or the Jakarta concord, a largely aspirational document, accompanied by **IORA action plan** that sets concrete short, medium and long term objectives across the six priority areas
## Opportunities/Potential
### Growth potential and associated potential for economic cooperation
- Rise of economies of India and China , growth of Industrialization in several Asian economies and in the African continent has contributed to increasing economic significance of this region.
- Trade and Energy flows.([[Importance of Indian Ocean Region#^aca7b7]])
### Rise of non-conventional security threats
- [[Indian Ocean Region]] hosts 35% of the world's population, majority of which is yet to derive benefits from increase in trade through the region. As a consequence, the region is fcing increasse  in non traditional security threadts (borne out of poverty and marginalization) such as human and drug trafficking, piracy primarily of the coast of Somalia and terrorism.
- Given their ==transnational nature==, IORA provides the platform to develop multiloateral security cooperation amongst the member states
### Strategic Significance of Indian Ocean has increased by China's and India's competition for regional influence
 The maritime component of China's VRI passes through the region, China has established its first overseas base in Djibouti and has been developing dual use port facilities in the countries of the region. India on the other hand, has a declared goal to emerge as a net security provider of the region.
### Presence of external powers such as the USA, France, UK increase the strategic significance of this region.
As a consequence, the global theater of international cooperation has shifted to Indo-Pacific with IOR as the major region of competition between global powers
## Threats to IORA
### Regional diversity
Extremely varied grouping along several dimensions - cultural, religious, ethnic, political etc. Although united by a common ocean, its vastness has facilitated various divergences to the point that it is arguably difficult to create a consensus on goals and agendas of IORA.
### Economic divergence
Only Singapore and Australia are developed countries in the entire grouping. Others are economically and institutionally weak. This leads to difficulty in implementing decisions, especially regarding economic integration.
### Lack of resources.
Nations in the grouping do not have deep pockets like that of China to pursue infrastructural development in the region. Countries like India are themselves suffering from infrastructural deficit
### Lack of Security Architecture
Region prone to non-conventional security threats.
### Vulnerability to external influence
Extra regional powers like the USA can influence the grouping in their own interest which might to lead to increasing security competition in the region that could have adverse effect on economic cooperation within the grouping.

## Way forward
- Important Nations like India and Indonesia should take the lead in making the association a vibrant one. Indonesia organised the first leaders' summit of IORA on *its twentieth anniversary* to ==impart political momentum== to the organization.
- Develop a strong ==maritime security architecture== to face the non-conventional and conventional security challenges.
- The group needs to work on six priority([[#^9556f9]]) areas that have been identified and produce tangible results to increase cooperation in the region
