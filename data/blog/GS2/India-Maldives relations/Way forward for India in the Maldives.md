# Way forward for India in the Maldives
#international-relations #seedling  #Maldives

- India should continue with its critical engagement with the Maldives and capacity building of the Maldives since it generated goodwill for India.
- India should support strengthening of democracy in the Maldives, while make sure its initiatives don't appear as efforts of regime management or political meddling.
- Since India's accomplishments will be judged against those of China, India needs to ensure timely delivery of infrastructure projects. India should break the perception that India promises, but China delivers
- India shouldn't have objections to strong commercial ties between China and Maldives but make sure Male is mindful of India's security interests
- As while dealing with all the small neighbours, India should stay magnanimous and operate under the principle of non reciprocity. India should stay true to [[Gujral Doctrine]]
