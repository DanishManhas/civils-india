First summit held in June 2018, in Guanzhou.
## Membership
- All SAARC members - Bhutan + Vietnam + Myanmar + China
- India was represented at a counsel general level

## Declared to be part of BRI, yet India is a member
- India's participation in CSAF, thoufh at Counsel general level, indicates India's delineation between trade and sovereignty issues
- India doesn't want to give China free passage in regional policy cooperation so that India's security is not threatened.
## Is it a replacement of [[SAARC]]?
-  All countries are not members of SAARc
-  Two South East Asian countries have also been insluded
-  So, not a replacement of SAARC
