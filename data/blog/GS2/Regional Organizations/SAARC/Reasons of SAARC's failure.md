#international-relations #seedling  #regionalOrganizations/SAARC 


## Size Assymetry
India accounts for 70% of the population of the 8 countries, 80% f the region's collective GDp and is by far the most militarily powerful country. India is the proverbial 298 lb gorilla on the beach whose slightest step is seen by the the 98lb goriilas as eviudence for its insensitivity.
India's Overwhelming  presence pushes other smaller countries into suspecting hegemony in their every proposal for greater cooperation.
## Reverse Regionalism
Being culturally, historically and geographically a single unit and the present borders being a consequence of artificial partition, the region suffers  from reverse regionalism . ie. Each country needs to assert its distinctiveness from India to justify its nationhood.
## Reductive nationalism
In several neighbouring countries, India has become a factor in domestic politics. Anti India rhetoric has become an easy route to political success

## India Pakistan rivalry
> Pakistan is a camel that slows down the pace of the South Asian Caravan
> ~C. Rajamohan

Pakistan and India are the two largest countries in SAARC and until and unless relations improve between the two, there is little hope for SAARC
## Role of Cold War Politics
Unlike [[ASEAN]] and[[European Union]], where the US supported greater regional cooperation against the expansion of communism, Cold War divided the countries of the region in two different camps. Pakistan allied with the USA while India demonstrated a pronounced tilt towards the USSR
## Pangs of Proximity
Highlighted by Prof. S. D. Muni
All countries in the region share border with India. The geographical proximity is associated with various tensions between India and the other countries.
## Economies of the region 
More supplementary than complementary in the region
## Resource Crunch
SAARC countries lack deep pockets like that of China to foster regional connectivity through various infrastructure projects. Furthermore, member countries are reluctant in increasing their contibution to SAARC affecting its effectiveness
