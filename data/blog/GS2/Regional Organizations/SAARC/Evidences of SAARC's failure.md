# Evidence of SAARC's failure
#international-relations #seedling  #regionalOrganizations/SAARC 


1.  **Irregular Summits**
 Though summits are intended to be held biannually, no summit has been held since the 2014 Kathmandu summit. The 2016 Islamabad summit was cancelled after boycott by India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan because of Pakistan propelling instability in the neighbouring countries
2. **One of the Least integrated regions of the world**
	Intra-regional trade stands as a dismal 5% compared to more than 65% in [[European Union]]and more than 25% in case of [[ASEAN]].
3. Intra-regional investment in South Asia is less than 1%
 Despite the enforcement of [[South Asia Free Trade Area Agreement (SAFTA)]] in 2006, its aim to liberalize trade. ie, achieve 0% tariff duties across the subcontinent by 2016 remains a far cry
4.  SAARC agreement on investment(proposed in 2007) has been in abeyance for more than a decade now
