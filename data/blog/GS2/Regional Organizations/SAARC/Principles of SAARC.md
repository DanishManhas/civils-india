#international-relations #seedling #SAARC 
1. Domestic non-interference(similar to [[ASEAN]] but different from [[European Union]]).
2. SAARC would not take up bilateral issues. It is a platform for negotiations of multilateral  regional issues. SAARC doesn't substitute bilateralism, rather compliments bilateral relations similar to [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]]. 
3. All the decisions are to be taken based on regional consensus similar to [[ASEAN]] and not [[European Union]]
