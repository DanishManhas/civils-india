- Bangladesh is a strategic wedge between mainland India and the North Eastern states. These states have shorter routes to sea through Bangladesh. Therefore, permanent transit route through Bangladesh would:
	1. spur socio-economic development of the NER
	2. contain insurgency
	3. overcome India's Chicken Neck dilemma(Siliguri Corridor)

- Bangladesh is important to secure sea lines in Indian Ocean, especially in south-eastern Indian Ocean which is prone to organized crimes such as human trafficking, drug trafficking etc.
