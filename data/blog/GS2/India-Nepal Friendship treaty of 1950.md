# India-Nepal Friendship treaty of 1950
#international-relations #seedling  #Nepal 

 ## Reason for signing of the treaty
 India's concerns regarding the expansionist policy of China
 ## Provisions of the treaty
 1. India recognizes Nepal as a sovereign state
 2. National treatment to meted out to each other's citizens in terms of employment, including public sector employment. However, India has relinquished its right to seek public employment in Nepal.
 3. Nepal will give primacy to India as far as infrastructure development - *HEP projects* and other business opportunities are concerned
## Problems with the treaty
The problem lies in the secret letters that were exchanged between the two
1. Both countries shall not tolerate any act of aggression against each other.
2. Nepal shall not import arms from any other country. It can do so only when India is unable to meet its requirements and with explicit permission of India.
## Nepal's objection to the treaty
1. It violates Nepal's sovereignty
2. India draws disproportionate benefit from the treaty
3. Since the treaty was signed with the Ranas, it lacks legitimacy
## Way forward
- India should Nepalese demand with respect to revision and amendment of the treaty since the treaty has already lost its relevance.
- An officially mandated *bilateral expert group* to review the treaty was constituted in 2016. Its final report is awaited.
