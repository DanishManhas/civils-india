An array of packaged snacks and fast foods breach safe limits of salt and fat content, says a laboratory analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment.

The agency tested salt, fat, trans-fat and carbohydrates in  popular “junk foods”, which consisting of chips, salted snacks, instant noodles and instant soup, and burgers, fries, fried chicken, pizzas, sandwiches and wraps.

**Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)**

-   To calculate how unsafe the foods tested were, the organisation relied on the concept of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) — a daily ceiling on the amount of salt, fat, carbohydrates and transfats.
-   The RDA is based on scientific consensus and has been agreed upon by expert bodies such as the World Health Organisation, and the National Institute of Nutrition in India.
-   It says that, ideally, no more than 5 gm of salt, 60 gm of fat, 300 gm carbohydrate and 2.2 gm of transfat should be consumed by an adult every day.
-   Further, the RDA from each breakfast, lunch and dinner should be no more than 25%, and that from snacks no more than 10%.

**Need to declare nutritional information**

-   According to the proposed draft Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, packaged food companies need to declare nutritional information such as calories (energy), saturated fat, trans-fat, added sugar and sodium per serve on the front of the pack.
-   The food labels are also required to declare, per serve percentage contribution to RDA on the front of the pack.
-   Though under discussions since 2015 and several drafts — the latest one came out in in July — these rules have yet to become law, and to be operationalised.

**Displaying ‘Red Octagon’**

-   The CSE concluded that all of the popular snacks and fast foods ought to be displaying a ‘Red Octagon’, a warning symbol employed in packaged foods in Chile and Peru.
-   The Red Octagon, which should be printed on the front of the pack, has a number and the name of the food component within that indicates how widely off the RDA a particular ingredient is.
-   Say, a Red “3.1, Salt” on a pack indicates that the salt it contains is 3.1 times the RDA for snacks.
