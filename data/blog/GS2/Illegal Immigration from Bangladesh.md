# Illegal Immigration from Bangladesh
#international-relations #seedling  #Bangladesh 

- called India's mexico problem
- currently, 40 million Bangladeshis are residing in India
## Reasons
- Strong push and pull factors
- Poverty, Agrarian crisis,large scale unemployment in Bangladesh on one hand and a better prospect of life offered by India on the other
- Porous borders
- Poor bordre managemnet
- Corruptioj in law enforcement agencies
- Cultural and Liguistic similarities with kinship relations accross the border making it difficult to identify Bangladeshis.
- Seemless Integration into Indian Society.
- Vote bank politics

## Consequences
- **Disturbance of cummunal harmony**. Instances of violence in Assam , specifically in Bodoland. Indian citizens , at times are also targeted in the communal violnece.
- Pressure on limited resources of the country
- raises strategic concerns because they offer acquire fake voter ids, participate in elections and influence public policy
- Threat of demographic inversion as has already happened in Tripura where tribals are now in minority.
## Steps taken by India
- Push backwards policy:
	- The policy of deportation doesn't work because government of Bangladesh doesnt accept that illegal migration from Bangladesh takes place into India
	- **Obstruction by fencing**: Govt. of India has constructed walls along the norder with barbed Electric wires. This has not stopped illegal migration rather , merely created hurdles to it. Many women children and livestock have succumbed to these electric wires. As a consequence, it has hurt India's image internationallu while remaining  a futile measure
 ## Solutions
Need to follow a multi-pronged approach.
1. Ensure better border management. Check corruption among the lawa enforcement agenceies.
2.  Identificaiton and registration of Indian citizens.
3. More effectively, India needs to issue work permits for the Bangladeshis. India already has porous borderes with Nepal and BHutan. Since India can't effectively stop migraton from Bangladesh from happening, it should regularise the process so that they become economic migrants and dont impact policy making in India
