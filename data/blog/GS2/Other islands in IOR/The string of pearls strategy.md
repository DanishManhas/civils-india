 ## Evidences
 1. China has developed several deep sea ports in the region like Gwadar in Pakistan, Chittagong in Bangladesh, Hambantota in Sri Lanka, Kyauk pyu in Myanmar.
 2. China has established its first overseas military base in Djibouti near Bab-el-Mandeb strait, one of the major choke points of the Indian Ocean.
 3. In pretext of the BRI initiative, China is carrying out large investments in various south Asian countries - building ports, roads, highways, bridges, canals( Kra canal). But heir use for surveillance and military purposes cannot be ruled out
	China is to develop a new economic zone on the Maldives' northernmost [[atoll]](iHavan project). It would allow China to monitor the strategic corridor connecting western and eastern coast.
4. China's growing economic engagement with IOR countries such as its FTAs with the Maldives and Pakistan, it being the largest foreign investor in Sri Lanka, largest trading partner of Bangladesh etc is a cause of concern for India.
