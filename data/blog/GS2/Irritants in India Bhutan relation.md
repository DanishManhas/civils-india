## Political interference, regime managemnet and economic arm twisting
India withdrew its subsidies on kerosene and cooking gas to Bhutan resulting in sudden price escalation of these products in Bhutan to express displeasure with Bhutan seeking to establish diplomatic relations with China. However, officially it was explained as an unfortunate technical lapse. India's big brother attitude was not taken well by Bhutan.
## Bhutan's economic overdependence on India
India accounts for 80% of Bhutan's exports, 60% of Bhutan's imports. 75% of the country's external dept is accounted by hydropower loans, primarily given by India.
Long-standing national objective of Bhutan is to achieve economic self-sufficiency through diversification of its economy
## Biased strategic approach of New Delhi
Bhutan often accuses India of employing India first approach rather than employing a mutually beneficial one.
Indian forces held ground during the **Doklam standoff** not for the concern of territorial integrity of Bhutan but for the concern regarding Chinese presence in the Chumbi Valley which stands as a wedge to India's Siliguri Corridor.
Bhutan alleges that India views Bhutan from a Chinese prism
## Treaty of 1949
The Article 2 of the treaty mandated govt. of Bhutan to be guided by advice of GOI in regard to its external relations
Taking Bhutan's demand into consideration, India Bhutan amended the said treaty in 2007. It freed Bhutan from 
1. seeking India's guidance to its foreign policy
2. Obtaining India's permission for arms import from a third country
Article 2 in the amended treaty ensures that neither govt. shall allow the use of their territory for activities harmful to national security and interest of the other

## Way Forward
- India needs to develop a stand alone Bhutan policy free of Chinese lens
- India should support Bhutan in its efforts to diversify its economy. It should see it as an opportunity to transform its relation from being the largest development partner to being the largest investor and business partner of Bhutan. 
- India should skill Bhutan's youth, develop a bilateral tourism policy and encourage private investment in Bhutan.
- India should detest from political meddling in Bhutan
