	> Indian constitution, a product not of a revolution but of deliberations to improve the existent administrative system
	> \- D.D. Basu		
	- The only practical difference between the constitution of 1949 and constitutional documents of the previous two centuries was that while the latter was imposed by an imperial power, the Republican constitution was made by the people themselves
	- That explains the majesty and the ethical value of this new instrument as well as the significance of its provisions that have been engrafted upon the pre-existing system
