# China in Sri Lanka
#international-relations #seedling #SriLanka 

During the Rajapaksha tenure(2005-14), there was evident tilt towards China. Sri Lanka looked to China for economic and diplomatic backing when the west was threatening columbo for the war crimes committed during the 4th Eelam war. Sri Lanka, as a consequence, awarded major infrastructure projects such as construction of Hambantota port, Colombo city projr=ect to China. Sri Lanka emerged as a keen supporter of China's BRI initiative. China is Sri Lanka's largest foreign investor. Chinese submarines were often seen docked on Sri Lankan ports.
With the election of national unity government in Sri Lanka, it sought to reassess and reframe the unjust conditions imposed on Sri Lanka by China. However, given the Chinese dept , the new government was forced to lease out the Hambantota port for 99 years in a 1.2 billion ==dept for equity swap== to China. 
Indian government has sought to counterbalance China's economic footprint in Sri Lanka by proposing interest in several infrastructure projects namely
- **Mattale airport** close to Hambantotta port
- Trincomalee oil tank farms
- Eastern terminal at Colombo port.
- **Palay port in Jaffna**: India has elicited cooperation with like-minded capital surplus countries like Japan for completion of these projects. However, given the political volatility in Sri Lanka, these projects continue to hang in fire
