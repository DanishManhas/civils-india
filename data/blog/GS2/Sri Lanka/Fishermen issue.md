# Fishermen issue
#international-relations #seedling  #SriLanka
It is traced to the maritime boundary agreement of 1974 and 76. It settled the disputed maritime boundaries between the two countries and ceded the barren, uninhabited islands of Kachchatheevu to Sri Lanka Thee 1974 agreement protected the traditional fishing rights of Indian fishermen to fish in and around the islands. However, these rights were also given away by the 1976 agreements.
The conflict arises because Indian fishermen are not willing to give away their 100-year-old fishing rights. Also, the successive state governments in Tamil Nadu have refused to accept the cession. The problem is further complicated by the use of bottom trawlers by Indian fishermen, which tends to destroy the marine ecology and threaten livelihood security of their Sri Lankan brethren.

## Suggested solutions
- Successive governments in Tamil Nadu have suggested getting back the Kachhatheevu islands on permanent lease to India. The licensed Indian fishermen should be allowed to fish in Sri Lankan waters up to 5 nautical miles with reciprocal rights extended to Sri Lankan fishermen, butt the government of India is not willing to reopen the boundary dispute.
- A joint working group has been established in 2016 to seek solution to this issue.
- Given the fact that the issue remains unresolved, both sides have agreed to set up a standard operating procedure to expedite the release and handing over of fishermen in each other's custody on completion of the respective legal and procedural formalities.
## True solution
The final solution to this vexed issue can be found only if the livelihood of the fishermen on both sides becomes the major focus. It can be secured through dialogue among the fishermen backed by their respective governments
