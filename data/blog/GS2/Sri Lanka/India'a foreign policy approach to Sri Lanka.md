# India'a foreign policy approach to Sri Lanka
#international-relations #seedling  #SriLanka

India's policy is 2 pronged or is said to ride ton two boats as it seeks to please the majority Sinhalese on one hand and the Tamils on the other. 
Given the fact that the Sinhalese constitute the majority population of Sri Lanka ([[Ethnic Composition of Sri Lanka]]), they will inadvertently be present in Sri Lanka's politics. Given the strategic and Economic importance of the country, India must have good relations with the political elite of Sri Lanka.
On the other, due to domestic sentiments, India seeks to support their Tamil brothers in Sri Lanka. 
Therefore India's foreign policy in Sri Lanka is decided by both Domestic and strategic consideration unlike China who policy is guided by the single concern of guiding its strategic concerns

When Tamil Nadu based regional party was part of the coalition in the center, Indian government was forced, taking into consideration Tamil sentiments, to vote against Sri Lanka in the [[UNHRC]] despite its fear of pushing Sri Lanka into Chinaâ€™s orbit.
