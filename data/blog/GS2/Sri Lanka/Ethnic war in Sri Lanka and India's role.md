# Ethnic war in Sri Lanka and India's role
#international-relations #seedling  #SriLanka

- The genesis of the ethnic crisis is traced back to the divide and rule policy of the British
## Citizenship Act 1948
- This act placed stringent requirements as far as documentary evidences are concerned to prove oneself citizen of Sri Lanka
- Tamils of Indian Origin could not produce these evidences and were rendered stateless. As a consequence, India faced the problem of refugee crisis and GOI got involved in the ethnic crisis
- India and Sri Lanka entered into three agreement- 1954, 64 and 74 through which India accommodated lots of Tamils from Sri Lanka
- Indira Gandhi after being made aware of the **natural increase conundrum** clarified that India wouldn't absorb any more Tamils from Sri Lanka
- Violent Attacks were made against Tamils in Sri Lanka
## Language Policy of 1956
- declared Sinhalese as the only official language of Sri Lanka to deprive Tamils from access to higher education and govt. jobs
- GOI got involved. It suggested a **3 language solution**
	- Sinhalese as the first official language
	- Tamil as the second
	- English as the link language
- The then President Bandarnaike accepted the proposal in principle, but was consequently assassinated.
- Rise of the rightist leader Jaywardeney. He made the language issue a political one, organized protests around it, and consequently came to power in Sri Lanka. He adopted coercive measures against Sri Lanka
## Rise of militancy
- The Tamil youth in Sri Lanka got disillusioned with the hitherto peaceful political movement seeking constitutional solutions.
-  There was rise of many militant organizations like LTTE, PLOTE, TELO etc. Of these, LTTE emerged as the strongest and claimed to be representative of Sri Lankan Tamils
## Civil War 
- Jaywardhane govt. sanctioned **operation Vadamarachi(1987)**. It imposed an economic blockade on Jaffna, causing a humanitarian crisis.
- Indian govt., not willing to accept a military solution to ethnic cleansing, air dropped food aid in Jaffna under **operation Poomalai** and compelled Sri Lanka to sign [[Rajiv Gandhi Jaywardhane accord]].
-Thus, Indian forces were sent to Jaffna to maintain the ceasefire.
## War between Indian peace keeping forces and LTTE
- IPKF were ill-equipped, ill armed, ill trained in the geography and terrain of Sri Lanka.
- There was some incidence of violence against the Tamil community in southern Sri Lanka, providing LTTE with a reason to pick up arms.
- Since Sri Lankan forces were in the barracks and LTTE were not happy with their marginalization in the accords, IPKF became their target.
- Indian peace keeping operatin in Sri Lanka is India's biggest strategic failure since independence. 1200 IPKF soldiers lost their lives and the then PM Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated.
## India's policy since then
Till the **4th Eelam war**, Indian govt. adopted hands-off policy approach in Sri Lanka. Former President RajaPaksha had come to powere promising an end to Tamil militancy in Sri Lanka
## India's role in the 4th Eelam War
- provided necessary intelligence to the Sri Lankan forces to identify and destroy ships carrying arms, ammunition and food to the Tamil Tigers
- India provided non-lethal weapons to Sri Lankan forces.
 ### Conditions for support by India
 - Based on assurances by the Sri Lankan govt. that after the end of the war, it would address the genuine Tamil grievances and effectively implement the 13th amendment
## After the war
- The Sri Lankan govt. didn't cooperate with India and refused to implement the 13th amendment
- India realistic it had no leverage at bilateral level, sought to work with international community at UNHRC.
- Since India didn't want to push Sri Lanka into Chinese orbit, ensured that the resolutions passed by UNHRC condemned LTTE and suggested action on the part of Sri Lankan government. It ensured that the resolutions were not very harsh.
- However, even after the election of a national unity govt. in Sri Lanka, the Tamil issue has not been satisfactorily resolved:
	- Northern province continues to be heavily militarized
	- Insufficient devolution of power to the northern province
	- Govt. has no power on land and/or police
	- Extremely slow process of releasing the acquired land necessary to restart livelihood/economic development
