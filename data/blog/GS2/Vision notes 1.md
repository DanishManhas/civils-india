## 1\. Comparison Scheme Student Notes:^

#### Comparison of the Indian Constitutional Scheme with that of Other Countries would center

```
around two main pivots:
```

```
1) Brief knowledge of the Constitution of the various countries, deemed important owing to
their current status or the fact that the Indian Constitution draws implicitly or explicitly
from them.
2) Comparison drawn vis-a-vis features of the Constitution (for example: Fundamental
Rights, DPSPs, Federalism et al).
```

## 2\. British Constitution

### 2.1. Salient Features

#### 2.1.1. Unwritten

```
One of the most important features of the British Constitution is its unwritten character. There
is no codified or structured document which may be called as the British Constitution unlike in
India, which is codified into various parts and schedules. Nevertheless many sources of the
constitutional law are written and these together with conventions and political traditions form
the British Constitution.
Indian Constitution, in comparison, is the lengthiest written constitution in the world.
```

#### 2.1.2. Evolutionary

```
The British Constitution is a specimen of evolutionary development. It was never framed by any
constituent assembly. It has an unbroken continuity of development over a period of more than
a thousand years. It is said that the British Constitution is a product of wisdom and chance.
The Indian Constitution has certain similarities as well as differences on this particular aspect. It
differs from the British Constitution to the extent that it is a written document and has well
defined provisions. However, it too is open to evolution, given that the provision of amendment
is kept such, so as to allow for the Constitution to evolve according to the need and sensibilities
of the time.
```

#### 2.1.3. Flexibility

```
The British Constitution is a classic example of a flexible constitution. It can be passed,
amended and repealed by a Simple Majority (50% of the members present and voting) of the
Parliament, since no distinction is made between a constitutional law and an ordinary law. Both
the constitutional law and an ordinary law are treated alike. The element of flexibility has
provided the virtue of adaptability and adjustability to the British Constitution. This quality has
enabled it to grow with needs of the time.
Indian Constitution, in contrast, is both flexible as well as rigid. This compliments the basic
ideology of the Indian Constitution quite well, wherein certain features like Sovereignty,
Secularism, Republic etc. have been held sacrosanct, but otherwise the Constitution lends itself
to amendability.
```

#### 2.1.4. Unitary vs. Federal Features

```
The British Constitution has a unitary character as opposed to a federal one. All powers of the
government are vested in the British Parliament, which is a sovereign body. Executive organs of
the state are subordinate to the Parliament, exercise delegated powers and are answerable to
it. There is only one legislature. England, Scotland, Wales etc. are administrative units and not
politically autonomous units.
```

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

The Indian Constitution, on the other hand, is federal. Student Notes:

```
Unitary Federal Confederation
All power lies with the
Centre
```

```
Powers is shared by the
national and the state
governments.
```

```
Units come together and form
the state. It is opposite to
Unitary system.
Centre delegates power to
the provincial government.
```

```
Powers for Provincial
Government comes from
the Constitution.
```

```
Real power with the units.
```

```
Example: Britain Example: India Example: EU, USA
```

#### 2.1.5. Parliamentary Executive

**This is one important similarity between the British and the Indian Constitution.**

Britain has a Parliamentary form of government. The King, who is sovereign, has been deprived  
of all his powers and authority. The real functionaries are Ministers, who belong to the majority  
party in the Parliament and remain in office as long as they retain its confidence.

The Prime Minister and his Ministers are responsible to the legislature for their acts and  
policies. Parliamentary system is based on the principle of collaboration and cooperation  
between the executive and legislative organs. The executive in British has individual legal  
responsibility whereas in India there is no legal responsibility.

#### 2.1.6. Sovereignty of Parliament

The term Sovereignty means Supreme Power. A very important feature of the British  
Constitution is sovereignty of the British Parliament (a written constitution being absent).

The British Parliament is the only legislative body in the country with unfettered power of  
legislation. It can make, amend or repeal any law.

Though in India’s case, we have legislature at state level too, yet the law making power of the  
Indian Parliament roughly corresponds to that of the British Parliament.

The courts have no power to question the validity of the laws passed by the British Parliament.  
The British Parliament may amend the constitution on its own authority, like an ordinary law of  
the land. It can make illegal what is legal and legalize what is illegal.

Here, there is a marked difference, vis-à-vis the power of Indian Judiciary to keep a tab on the  
legality of the law framed. Also, the ‘Basic Structure’ doctrine, lends the Indian Judiciary further  
power to question the legality of the law (Judicial Review), in light of the fact that the Supreme  
Court of India is the highest interpreter of the Constitution of India.

#### 2.1.7. Role of Conventions

Conventions are known as unwritten maxims (rules) of the Constitution. They provide flexibility  
and avoid amendments.

Most constitutions of the world have conventions. A necessary corollary to the unwritten  
character of the British constitution is that conventions play a very vital role in the British  
political system. For example, while the Queen has the prerogative to refuse assent to a  
measure passed by the British Parliament, but by convention, she doesn’t do so and the same  
has become a principle of the constitution itself.

However, the legal status of conventions is subordinate to the written law.

Even in India conventions play a vital role in functioning of Parliament. For instance: position of  
Deputy Speaker is offered to opposition party in India, etc.

#### 2.1.8. Rule of Law Student Notes:^

Another important feature of the British Constitution is the Rule of Law. Constitutionalism or  
limited government is the essence of Rule of Law. This checks the arbitrary action on part of the  
Executive. According to **Dicey** , there are three principles of Rule of Law, found in Britain:

-   Protection from arbitrary arrest and the opportunity to defend oneself.
-   Equality before Law which means that all persons are equal before law, irrespective of their  
    position or rank. It is different from the concept of Administrative Law, which gives  
    immunity of various types to public servants. In the absence of Constitution and  
    Fundamental Rights in Britain, the judiciary protects this law. So this system is called as the  
    Principle of Common Laws. In Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India case (1978) SC held that the  
    ‘procedure established by law’ within the meaning of Article 21 must be ‘right and just and  
    fair’ and ‘not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive’ otherwise, it would be no procedure at all  
    and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied. Thus, the ‘procedure established  
    by law’ has acquired the same significance in India as the ‘due process of law’ clause in  
    America.
-   The rights of people in Britain are guaranteed by the judiciary. The Judiciary gives  
    recognition to the common laws. Thus, the people in Britain enjoy rights, even in the  
    absence of a Bill of Rights or Fundamental Rights. The Constitution is the result of rights of  
    the individuals protected by the courts in British Constitution whereas in India, the  
    Constitution is the source of the individual rights.

#### 2.1.9. Independence of Judiciary

The Rule of Law in Britain is safeguarded by the provision that judges can only be removed from  
office for serious misbehavior and according to a procedure established according to which the  
consent of both the Houses of Parliament is required. So, the judges are able to give their  
judgments without any fear or favour.

The same has been adopted in India, where independence of the Judiciary is hailed as an  
unmistakable part of the Constitution (one of the features of the ‘Basic Structure’ doctrine).

### 2.2. Organs of the State

#### 2.2.1. Executive

The Executive in Britain is called as Crown. Earlier, the Crown symbolized King. Now, the King is  
part of the Crown.

The Crown, as an institution, consists of the following:

-   King,
-   Prime Minister,
-   Council of Ministers (CoM),
-   Permanent Executive, the Civil Servants,
-   Privy Council.

**Crown:** “King is dead. Long live the King.”

In Britain, initially all power lied with the King. Later on, power shifted out of the institution of  
the King to the institution of CoM headed by the Prime Minister, Permanent Executive and the  
Privy Council etc. Today, the Crown comprises of all these institutions. Hence, the first part of  
the statement describes the King as a person, while the second part describes the King or  
Crown as an institution.

#### Nature of Monarchy

Britain has a constitutional monarchy which is not incompatible with democracy. This is  
because essentially the powers of the monarch as head of the state - currently Queen Elizabeth

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

II - are ceremonial. The most important practical power is the choice of the Member of Student Notes:  
Parliament to form a government, but invariably the monarch follows the convention that this  
opportunity is granted to the leader of the political party or coalition, which has majority in the  
House of Commons.

Despite its lack of real power, the monarchy still has several important roles to play in  
contemporary Britain. These include:

-   Representing UK at home and abroad,
-   Settings standards of citizenship and family life,
-   Uniting people despite differences,
-   Allegiance of the armed forces,
-   Maintaining continuity of British traditions,
-   Preserving a Christian morality etc.

In addition, consider the following:

-   Parliamentary system requires two heads:  
    o First head, as head of the state. He represents the nation and provides continuity to the  
    administration.  
    o Second head is the head of the government. He has real powers because the house has  
    confidence in the Prime Minister. The PM is the leader of the House. He represents the  
    majority of the House.
-   The institution of kingship is a source of psychological satisfaction. It is said that, “with the  
    King in the Buckingham Palace, the Englishmen sleep peacefully in their houses”.
-   The King is of great help in critical times. He usually has a very long experience and can give  
    valuable advice in the interest of the country.
-   According to Bagehot, the King has three rights:  
    o Right to warn,  
    o Right to encourage,  
    o Right to be informed.
-   Abolishing the kingship will require an elected head. An elected head, with no real powers,  
    will have its own set of problems.

In contrast, no provision of Monarchy exists in case of Indian Constitution. Indeed, holding of  
titles like King etc. are forbidden as per Article 18 of the Fundamental Rights, thus emphasizing  
equality of all Indian citizens.

#### British Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers

Britain has a Cabinet form of government. A cabinet is a plural or collegiate form of  
government. The power doesn’t lie in one person, but the entire Council of Ministers. The  
principle is, “all Ministers sink and swim together”. It is based on collective responsibility  
towards the Lower House.

The Cabinet has its origins in the Privy Council set up to advise the King. The roles of cabinet  
include the following:

-   Approving policy (major policy making body),
-   Resolving disputes,
-   Constraining the Prime Minister,
-   Unifying government,
-   Unifying the parliamentary party etc.

Moreover, the Cabinet is the ultimate body of law making in the Parliamentary system. It is  
formed out of the party/group, which enjoys majority in the House. The cabinet meetings are  
held in private.

British Prime Minister Student Notes:

**1\. Position of the Prime Minister**  
\- PM is the captain of the ship of the state.  
\- PM is the head of the Cabinet.  
\- The party of the PM enjoys majority in the House.  
\- He/She is the connecting link between the King and the Cabinet as well as the King and  
the Parliament.  
\- The life of the House depends on the PM as he/she may advice the dissolution of the  
House.  
\- The other Ministers are appointed on the advice of the PM  
\- The term of the other Ministers also depends on the PM  
2\. The **P.M. as first among equals** : this is also called as _Primus Inter Pares_ or _Inter Stella_  
_Luna Minores_. This explains the PM’s position w.r.t. other ministers. In the cabinet  
system, there is a principle of collective responsibility; hence other ministers are also  
important but PM remains a 'key stone of the cabinet arch'.  
The relative position of the PM and other ministers in a Parliamentary system can be  
compared to the relative position of the President and his/her secretaries in the  
Presidential system.  
In the Presidential system, members of the Cabinet are chosen by the President. In USA,  
spoils system exists. The Secretaries are not members of the Congress.  
In the Parliamentary system, ministers are also the members of either House. The PM  
cannot treat them as his/her subordinates. Theoretically, the PM should consider  
him/herself as only first among equals, must give due respect to other members of the  
Cabinet and should take decisions in consultation with them.

However, the P.M. is first because:

-   He/She is the one who is appointed first, since he/she is the leader of the House of  
    Commons.
-   Other ministers are appointed on his/her advice.
-   Other ministers can be removed on his/her advice.

**_PM as moon among stars:_**

This statement gives a more realistic view of the position of PM In practice, the PM gains  
prominence and he is not simply the first among equals. Both formal and informal factors are  
responsible for this.

-   Formal Factors: He/She is the link between the Parliament and the King, and ministers are  
    appointed/removed on his/her advice etc.
-   Informal Factors: Personality factors, position of his/her party, external/internal emergency  
    like situation.

**_Difference between the British and Indian PM_**

Constitutional position of the Indian PM is modeled on the British PM, with one difference. In  
India, the PM can be a member of either House of Parliament, i.e. Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha.  
However, this is not so in Britain. It is a convention in Britain that the PM will always be a  
member of the Lower House (House of Commons) only.

#### Privy Council

It has been one of the advisory bodies to the King. It has lost relevance because of the  
emergence of the Cabinet in the recent times. Cabinet decisions are the decisions of the Privy  
Council. It has some supervisory role w.r.t. University of Oxford, Cambridge etc. It also has some  
role in resolution of disputes related to the Church as well as a Court of Appeal in some  
admiralty cases.

#### Permanent Civil Servants/British Bureaucrats Student Notes:^

Indian bureaucracy is modeled on the British bureaucracy.

**Some features:**

-   Bureaucracy in Britain is generalist.
-   They are expected to be politically neutral.
-   They are recruited through the competitive exams.
-   They enjoy a lot of immunities.
-   It is said that the British bureaucracy is not representative and is still elitist in nature.
-   Bureaucrats are known as New Despots.
-   It is said that the Bureaucracy thrives behind the cloak of ministerial responsibility.
-   It has also been compared with Frankenstein’s monster (overpowering the Ministers).

#### 2.2.2. Legislature

**_Essential differences between the two systems:_**

There is a natural tendency to compare the Parliament of India with the British Parliament. But  
our Parliament and Parliamentary Institutions and procedures are not a copy of the  
Westminster system. There are fundamental differences between the two systems.

British Parliament has grown through some three hundred years of history. In Britain, the  
Parliament can said to be the only institution, which exercises sovereign powers and on which  
there are no limits because there is no written constitution.

India, on the other hand, has a written constitution. Powers and authorities of every organ of  
the Government and every functionary are only as defined and delimited by the constitutional  
document. The power of Parliament itself is also clearly defined and delimited by the  
Constitution. However, within its own sphere, the Parliament is supreme.

Also, Parliament is a representative institution of the people. But it is not sovereign in the sense  
in which the British Parliament is sovereign and can do or undo anything. The point is that in  
the sense of constitutional sovereignty, their powers are not limited by a constitutional  
document.

Moreover, our constitutional document provides for fundamental rights of the individual, which  
are justiciable in courts of law. And any law passed by the Parliament, which abridges any of the  
fundamental rights can be declared ultra vires by the courts.

The courts adjudicate the disputes and while doing so, they can interpret the constitution and  
the laws. Also, the Parliament has the constituent powers and within certain limitations it can  
suitably amend the constitution.

The British Parliament is bicameral, that is there are two houses or chambers- The House of  
Lords (strength not fixed) and The House of Commons (strength fixed at 650 members).

#### The House of Lords

The House of Lords is the second chamber, or upper house, of the United Kingdom's bi-cameral  
(two chamber) Parliament. The House of Lords has hereditary members. Moreover, it has the  
largest number of Life Peers, Church/Religious peers (Ecclesiastical Peers) and Law Lords.  
Together with the House of Commons and the Crown, the House of Lords form the UK’s  
Parliament.

The House of Lords can propose and make changes, known as amendments. However its  
powers are limited; if it doesn’t approve of a piece of legislation, it can only delay its passage  
into law for up to a year. After that, there are rules to ensure that the wishes of the House of  
Commons and the Government of the day prevail.

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

In fact, the House of Lords could be labeled as one of the weakest upper house in the world. Student Notes:  
Since the passage of the Act of 1919 and 1949, the House of Lords has lost all real legislative  
powers. It is simply a delaying chamber now. It can delay an ordinary bill for a maximum period  
of one year and money bill for a maximum period of one month.

In comparison to Rajya Sabha in India, the House of Lords is a weak house. Rajya Sabha has  
equal powers with Lok Sabha, as far as an ordinary bill is concerned (though, there is provision  
of a joint session, but it is an extraordinary device).

Rajya Sabha has equal power with Lok Sabha as far as the amendment of the Constitution is  
concerned. Rajya Sabha is also a delaying chamber, like the House of Lords, as far as a Money  
Bill is concerned. Rajya Sabha can delay the bill for a maximum of fourteen days. Rajya Sabha  
does have some special powers, which are not available to Lok Sabha; for example: Articles 249  
(power to legislate with respect to a matter in the State List in the national interest) and Article  
312 (creation of one or more All India Services).

**_Comparison between the House of Lords and Senate of USA_**

-   Senate is called as the strongest Upper House. It enjoys equal power with the House of  
    Representative in the context of an Ordinary Bill, a Constitutional Bill and even in passage of  
    a Money Bill. It is customary to introduce Money Bill in the Lower House.
-   The Senate also enjoys some special powers not available to the House of Representatives.  
    For example, ratification of international treaties, ratification of higher appointments.

The House of Lords did enjoy a privilege that it used to be the highest Court of Appeal in Britain.  
But this has now ceased to exist, as the Supreme Court has been created by the Constitutional  
Reform Act, 2005 (SC established in 2009).

#### The House of Commons

This is the lower chamber, but the one with most authority. It is chaired by the Speaker. Unlike  
the Speaker in the US House of Representatives, the post is non-political and indeed, by  
convention, the political parties do not contest the Parliamentary constituency held by the  
Speaker. The number of members varies slightly from time to time to reflect population change.

In modern practice, the Prime Minister is the head of the Government and is always a member  
of the majority party or coalition in the House of Commons. The Cabinet comprises primarily  
leading House of Commons Members of the majority, although Members of the House of Lords  
have served as Cabinet ministers. In fact, designating someone outside Parliament as a “ **life  
peer** ” has been one recent means of bringing someone essentially from private life into the  
Government. (In Britain, a life peer is a person who is given a title such as 'Lord' or 'Lady' which  
they can use for the rest of their life but which they cannot pass on when they die.)

The Prime Minister, although head of the Government and an MP, is now not usually the Leader  
of the House of Commons. The Leader of the House of Commons, a member of the  
Government, is the chief spokesman for the majority party on matters of the internal operation  
of the House of Commons. The Office of the Leader issues announcements of the impending  
House of Commons schedule, and a routine inquiry from the Opposition’s counterpart serves as  
an occasion for the Leader to announce the business for the next two weeks of session.

In the House of Commons, party organizations (akin to the Republican Conference or  
Democratic Caucus) meet regularly to discuss policy, and to provide an opportunity for  
backbench party members to voice their views to ministers or shadow cabinet members in a  
private forum.

**_Features of British Speaker_** Student Notes:

-   The position of the Speaker is a position of great prestige and dignity. In UK, there is a  
    convention that once a Speaker, always a Speaker. It means that a Speaker’s constituency is  
    unchallenged. Once a person is appointed as a Speaker he/she gives formal resignation  
    from his/her political parties. He/She has a casting vote and ultimate disciplinary powers  
    with respect to the conduct of the House and MPs.

**_US Speaker (Speaker of House of Representatives)_**

-   He/She is expected to be a party man, not expected to be neutral; instead he/she favours  
    his party. He/She does not have final disciplinary powers, which lie with the House itself. In  
    USA, the Speaker can vote in the beginning.

**_Speaker of Lok Sabha in India_**

Though the position of Speaker of Lok Sabha in India is midway between the British and the US  
model, it is theoretically closer to the British model. But similar conventions do not exist. For  
instance:

-   It is not necessary for the Speaker to resign from his party
-   If he/she decides to resign, he/she will not be disqualified under the Anti-defection law.
-   There is no convention in India that he/she will be elected uncontested.

#### 2.2.3. Judiciary

Under the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty, the judiciary lacks the intrinsic power to strike  
down an Act of Parliament. However, the subordination of common law to statute law does not  
mean the subordination of the judiciary to the executive. Courts in Britain retain certain  
powers:

-   Of interpreting the precise meaning of a statute.
-   Of reviewing the actions of ministers and other public officials by applying the doctrine  
    of _ultra vires_ (beyond powers).
-   Of applying the concept of natural justice to the actions of ministers and others.

Because the Parliament is sovereign, the government can seek to overturn the decisions of the  
courts by passing amendment legislation. The power of judicial review provides the judiciary  
with a potentially significant role in the policy process.

In recent decades, there has been an upsurge in judicial activism for several reasons:

-   Judges have been more willing to review and quash ministerial action,
-   British membership of the EU,
-   The incorporation of the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights) into domestic law,
-   Devolution of powers to elected assemblies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,
-   The creation of a Supreme Court in 2009.

#### Comparison between the Indian and British Judiciary

**_Similarities_**

-   The actions of Executive can be declared ultra vires in both the systems.
-   The judiciary is considered the highest interpreter of the Constitution.
-   Off late, there has been a splurge in judicial activism in Britain and judiciary is becoming  
    more and more active. A similar evolution of judiciary has been noticeable in the Indian  
    case too**_._**

**_Differences_** Student Notes:

-   In case of British system, the lack of concept of ‘Basic Structure’ makes amending power of  
    the Parliament supersede any judicial pronouncement. Whereas, in case of the Indian  
    Judiciary system, the concept of ‘Basic Structure’ has provided a potent tool to Judiciary by  
    which it can scuttle down any Executive or Legislative action, which it deems as against the  
    basic spirit of the Constitution.
-   British legal system is completely based on ‘Common Law System’. Common Law System  
    implies that law is developed by the judges through their decisions, orders, or judgments  
    (also referred to as precedents). However, unlike the British system, which is entirely based  
    on the Common Law System, where it had originated from, the Indian system incorporates  
    the Common Law System along with the statutory and regulatory laws.

**Note:** By Constitutional Reform Act, 2005 the Supreme Court has come into existence as the  
highest Court of Appeal. A National Judicial Appointment Commission has also been  
introduced.

Brief Synopsis of comparison drawn above:

**_British Constitution:_**

-   Product of history and the result of evolution,
-   There is a difference between theory and practice,
-   Flexible and unitary constitution,
-   Parliamentary government,
-   Rule of law and civil liberties applicable.

## 3\. Constitution of the United States of America Student Notes:^

### 3.1. Salient Features

While the American Constitution is the shortest (of any major government in the world) and the  
first written constitution, India’s Constitution is the lengthiest written constitution in the World.

The American Constitution is a very rigid constitution consisting of only Seven Articles and  
twenty-seven amendments, so far. Originally, the India Constitution consisted of 395 Articles in  
22 Parts, with 8 Schedules. As of January 2020, it consists of 470 articles in 25 parts, 12  
schedules, and 5 appendices.

The US Constitution was finalized in a convention held on September 17, 1787, which required  
its ratification by a minimum of nine States, for it to be enforced. By the end of July 1788,  
eleven States had ratified it and the Constitution was put into operation on 13th September

1788.  The Indian Constitution, on the other hand, was adopted by her Constituent Assembly on  
    26 th November 1949, and came into effect on 26th January 1950.

America has adopted the doctrine of dual ship in respect of its Constitution and citizenship. It  
has two Constitutions, one, for America as whole and another for each State. American people  
have two citizenships, one of USA and another of their respective State. On the other hand,  
India has one constitution and concept of single citizenship for every citizen of the country.

#### 3.1.1. Nature of the Constitution

The American Constitution is described as a truly Federal Constitution. It was ratified by 50  
Independent States. Further, the Federal Government and States have their own Constitutions  
and do not interfere in each other’s functions.

On the other hand, India has only one Constitution, wherein the Central government interferes  
with functions of State governments in the form of, inter alia:

-   Appointment of Governors,
-   Governor having the power of reserving the States’ bills for consent of the President,
-   Central government’s power to impose President’s rule in the States etc.

#### 3.1.2. Nature of Federalism

While the USA is a Dual Federation, India is a Cooperative Federation.

```
Dual Federation (USA) – both the Centre
and state are completely independent.
They are complete governments
```

```
Cooperative Federation (India) – Interdependence of
Centre and state govt. Neither of them is independent of
the other. Centre usually has the role of big brother
Centrifugal federalism Centripetal federalism
Symmetrical federalism – all states are
given equal representation in Senate
```

```
Asymmetrical federalism –
```

1.  States have been given representation in Rajya Sabha  
    on the basis of their population.
2.  Articles 370, 371 provide special provisions to few  
    states.  
    USA is a Legislative federation. This means  
    that States have dominance in law making.

```
India is an Executive federation. This means that states
are important at the executive level only.
USA is an indestructible union of
indestructible states
```

```
India is an indestructible union of destructible states
```

```
USA constitution provides a role to states
in ratifying the international treaties
through the Senate
```

```
There is no such provision for states in the Indian
Constitution
```

#### 3.1.3. Form of Government Student Notes:^

##### USA

-   America has adopted a Presidential form of government, in which the people directly elect  
    the executive President.
-   The President is powerful and not accountable to the House of Congress.
-   The term of the American President is 4 years (fixed term).
-   One can hold the office of the President for only two terms.
-   The President can appoint his own staff, which may be neither from the House of  
    Representative or Senate, in assisting in the administration of the government. The staff is  
    not accountable to the Houses of Congress.

This means that the President is independent in the administration of the government and  
rather directly responsible to the people of USA.

**India**

-   India has adopted a Parliamentary form of government.
-   The President of India is the executive head of the Indian government. He is indirectly  
    elected by the legislators of Centre and states, and is not accountable to the Parliament.
-   The President runs the government with the aid and advice of the Prime Minster and the  
    Council of Ministers.
-   Unlike USA, the Indian President holds the office for five years.
-   He can be elected any number of times.

The impeachment of the President by the legislature is the only similarity in both the  
Constitutions.

### 3.2. President

The position of the American President combines both the Head of State and the Head of  
Government into one.

#### 3.2.1. Qualification

Only a natural born citizen of USA can become the President, and not a person who has  
acquired the citizenship. Also, he must have attained the age of 35 years and must have stayed  
in USA for at least 14 years.

On the other hand, the Indian President should be a citizen of India, wherein citizenship might  
be either natural or acquired.

#### 3.2.2. Election of the President

Presidential election is indirect, through Electoral College.

#### Electoral College

-   Strength of Electoral College = Total members in House of Representatives + Senate + 3  
    members from Washington D.C. = 435 + 100 + 3 = 538
-   Winning Candidate requires an absolute majority (50% + 1) of the total members of the  
    Electoral College, i.e. 270.

In the House of Representatives, members from different states are not fixed, while in Senate  
members from different states are equal and fixed.

#### Election of Electors

-   The voters vote for the members of the Electoral College
-   System of election is the List System

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   Each state has a responsibility to conduct these elections Student Notes:^
-   The party that wins the majority of the votes represents the state in entirety
-   Electors meet in their respective capital and vote for the Presidential candidate

#### 3.2.3. Functions of the President of USA

#### Executive Functions

-   Appointments
-   Representing the country
-   Preparation of the Budget

#### Legislative Functions

-   No presence in legislature
-   The President doesn’t address the legislature
-   He cannot dissolve the legislature
-   He can send messages to the legislature (the system of sending messages exists in USA  
    because there is Separation of Power. So this is the way that the President can interact. The  
    system of sending messages is found in India also, but the logic of the provision is not clear  
    because the President has no discretionary power and he has to act on the advice of the  
    P.M.)

Veto Power

Under the Constitution, the President may respond to a bill passed by the Congress in one of  
the three ways. He may sign it, veto the bill by returning it to Congress, or do nothing. If he  
does nothing, the bill becomes a law after the passage of ten days, excluding Sundays. However,  
if the Congress adjourns sooner than ten days, the bill dies, under the “ **pocket veto** ” provision.  
If the President vetoes a bill, the Congress can still enact it into a law bypassing the measure  
again with two-thirds majority in both the houses. This is known as “ **qualified veto”.**

#### 3.2.4. Legislative Proposals

The Constitution also authorizes the President to “recommend to Congress’ consideration such  
measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” Unlike the veto, which is a limited and  
somewhat negative instrument for stopping legislation, the duty to recommend legislation has  
over time become the primary mechanism, by which the nation's political agenda is influenced.

#### Indian President

-   In India, the President has the power to send back a bill to the Parliament for  
    reconsideration. But, when the Parliament has reconsidered the bill and then passes it with  
    the required majority, the President has no option but to sign the bill.
-   Practically, the Prime Minster and his Cabinet almost always enjoy a simple majority, except  
    in a coalition government. So, it does not pose a major hurdle for the Prime Minster and his  
    cabinet to get the consent of the President for the bill.

However, a significant departure from the US Presidential Scheme of things is that unlike the  
US, the Indian Constitution does not prescribe any time limit for signing the bill by President.  
Therefore, he can keep the bill without signing it for an indefinite period under the disguise of  
consideration, which can frustrate the Prime Minster and his cabinet. Obviously, this leads us to  
the question whether the Indian President’s pocket veto is more powerful than the  
US President’s pocket veto.

#### 3.2.5. Date of Retirement and Oath Student Notes:^

##### US

-   A unique feature of the US Constitution is that it has prescribed the date and timing of  
    retirement of the outgoing President as well as members of the Congress.
-   The terms of President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January.
-   It means that the new President and Vice President shall take oath of the office on  
    20 th January (or 21st January, if 20th is a Sunday) at noon of their first year of office.
-   The election of the President and Vice president are held in the month of November and in  
    the same month results are announced.

Thus, Americans are informed much earlier about their new President.

Naturally, the question is how this time schedule is maintained. In case of President’s death,  
resignation, or impeachment, the Vice President shall become the President for the remaining  
period. In this way, duration of the President is kept intact and the next elected President takes  
oath on the scheduled date.

#### India

-   In India, if the President dies or is impeached, or submits resignation, the Vice President  
    becomes the President until fresh elections are held. The newly elected President holds the  
    office for a full term of five years.
-   Hence, unlike the American system the time schedule cannot be maintained, in the case of  
    India.

#### 3.2.6. Impeachment of the President of USA.......................................................................

-   **Reasons** : Treason, Bribery, High Crimes of Misdemeanor. No system of impeachment for  
    violation of the Constitution, unlike the Indian Constitution
-   **Process of impeachment**  
    o Charges will be leveled against the President in the House of Representatives.  
    o It has to be passed by 2/3rd majority by the House of Representatives.  
    o Senate will be the investigating house.  
    o In this process, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of USA will be the presiding  
    officer.  
    o If convicted, he can be removed only when 2/3rd members of the Senate pass a  
    resolution in this context.

### 3.3. Vice President

#### 3.3.1. Election of Vice President

The qualification for the President and the Vice President is the same. Since the elections take  
place simultaneously, the process of elections is also the same.

**Earlier Method:** The candidate coming first used to be declared as the President and second as  
the Vice President.

**Present Method:** Separate elections, but at the same time and in the same manner.

#### 3.3.2. Tenure of a Vice President as a President

A Vice President may become a President because of vacancy in the office of the President.  
There are two situations:

-   If the Vice President has come to the office when the President has already served the  
    office for more than two years. Then the Vice President can be President for the remaining  
    term and in addition for two more terms he can serve as a President

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   If the Vice President came to the office when the remaining term of the outgoing President Student Notes:^  
    was more than two years, then he will be eligible for only one more term

#### 3.3.3. Functions of the Vice President of USA

-   Ex-officio chairperson of Senate and has casting vote
-   The office of the Indian Vice President is modeled on the US office, with some differences
-   The office of Vice President is called as **His Superfluous Highness**

### 3.4. US Legislature/US Congress

It consists of two houses: House of Representatives and the Senate.

#### 3.4.1. House of Representatives

-   One of the weakest lower house in the world
-   It consists of 435 members
-   System of direct elections
-   Representation of people may differ in number from different states

#### 3.4.2. SENATE

-   Permanent body
-   Strongest upper house in the world
-   It has equal powers in ordinary bills, amendment bills and money bills.
-   Term of a Senator is six years. 1/3rd of the members/Senators retire every two years.

### 3.5. Committee System in USA

USA has the strongest committee system in the world. It is said that the US Congress works in  
the Committees.

**_Difference from British and Indian System:_**

-   In Britain and India, a bill is introduced in the House and the first reading takes place and  
    then it is referred to the Committee
-   In USA, a bill is introduced and then directly referred to the Committee, before even the  
    first reading

**Pigeon Hole:** A bill in USA may get killed at the Committee stage itself. This is known as Pigeon  
Holing the bill.

### 3.6. Duration of Representative Bodies at the Centre

#### 3.6.1. US

-   America’s House of Representative and Senate are permanent bodies.
-   The terms of the members of the Representative and Senate come to an end on 3rdJanuary.

#### 3.6.2. India............................................................................................................................

-   In India, during an emergency, the duration of Lok Sabha can be extended by one year, or  
    can be shortened by holding pre-matured elections.
-   The ruling party forms opinion based on their party’s prospects in the next election. It may  
    recommend for the dissolution of Lok Sabha and suggest the President to hold the election  
    at an appropriate time, which may be based on political expediency.

### 3.7. Doctrine of Separation of Power and the System of Checks and Balances

The theory of Separation of Powers started with John Locke and became popular with  
Montesquieu (18th century philosophers).

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

Why Separation of Powers/Functions? Student Notes:

-   According to Montesquieu – liberty is not protected, unless there is Separation of Power.
-   Separation of Power with judiciary is a universal feature in all democracies.
-   The Presidential system provides Separation of Power w.r.t. all three organs of the  
    government, whereas in the Parliamentary system there is a fusion of legislative and  
    executive powers.

Note: For details about the Separation of Power and the System of Checks and Balances, kindly  
refer to the separate document on the same topic

#### 3.7.1. US

-   The US Constitution strictly adheres to the doctrine of Separation of Power proposed by  
    Locke and Montesquieu. Separation of Power is complete in US.
-   All the three branches of the government have separate functions.
-   The term of Legislature and Executive are fixed and do not depend on each other.
-   None of the member of the Legislature can be a member of the Executive.
-   The Houses of Congress enact the law; the President executes the law; and the Supreme  
    Court interprets the law.
-   The American President has no privilege of law making power. Moreover, he is neither a  
    member of the House of Representative nor that of Senate.
-   By confirming veto power but equally not confirming the law-making power to the  
    President, the Congress controls the Presidents and vice versa. In this way, ‘Checks and  
    Balance’ are maintained.

#### 3.7.2. India............................................................................................................................

-   Theoretically, we may say that the doctrine of Separation of Power is adopted in our  
    Constitution, but it is only between the Executive and Judiciary.
-   The President is a part of the Union Executive. Yet, it is the Prime Minster and the Council  
    Ministers who are the real executive because the President has to act on the aid and advice  
    of the Council of Ministers.
-   They have dual capacity:  
    o One, in capacity of executive; and  
    o Two, in the capacity of lawmaker.
-   The Prime Minster, in his capacity as the leader of the ruling party can enact a law, which  
    his administration executes. Thus, the Prime Minster and his Council Ministers enact the  
    law and the administration executes the same, which is per se, contradictory to the  
    doctrine of Separation of Power.

#### 3.7.3. Checks and Balances

No organ of the government can be given complete liberty. Hence there have to be checks and  
balances.

How are checks and balances achieved in the US Constitution?

-   Judiciary checks on other branches of the government, by judicial review of the executive  
    as well as legislative acts.
-   How Congress checks the President or powers of the President?  
    o It is necessary to ratify the international agreements and higher appointments  
    o Principle of no taxation without representation  
    o Impeachment of the President
-   How President checks the Congress?  
    o By the use of veto powers (Congress can pass a bill against Presidential veto with 2/3rd  
    majority. So the President doesn’t have absolute veto.

o Pocket Veto: Two situations arise – Student Notes:
▪ Congress in session for ten days: Bill can be passed even without the assent of the
President
▪ Congress in session for less than ten days: Bill will lapse.

-   President and Congress applying checks on Judiciary  
    o Appointment of Judges: appointed by the President and ratified by the Senate  
    o Removal of Judges: removed through impeachment by the Congress and approved by  
    the President  
    o Salaries and emoluments controlled by the President

### 3.8. Fundamental Rights

While US has incorporated the “Bill of Rights”, India has incorporated “Fundamental Rights” in  
its Constitution.

However, the American Constitution has provided additional human rights, which are not to be  
explicitly found in the Indian Constitution.

-   Freedom of press is explicitly provided under the 1st amendment of the US Constitution,  
    while in India it is implicitly read under the Article 19\[1\]\[a\], freedom of speech and  
    expression.  
    Petition to the Supreme Court is a fundamental right in India, where as in US it is the  
    government that is petitioned (In case of US, the word “government” has a wider  
    connotation and encompasses not only the executive, but also the higher judiciary).
-   The Americans have a right to keep arms and guns for the protection of their life and  
    property. This was provided under the 2nd Amendment.  
    Therefore, guns and arms are sold like any other commodity in US without legal hassles,  
    whereas in India it is a total contrast, because apart from not being a fundamental right, it  
    is a highly regulated legal right.

5 th Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees that an accused will be tried for criminal  
offence with a system of “Grand Jury”. Grand Jury means that common people are selected by  
the government randomly, representing the community. They play a part in deciding the guilt of  
the accused persons. The number of persons selected to be in the grand jury varies from 6 to  
12, or even more, if the case is controversial.

On the other hand, in India criminal trials are adjudicated by the Judges only.

-   Further, in US, no person’s life and liberty shall be deprived without “due process” of law.  
    o Due process means that the content and procedure of law must be just, fair, and  
    equitable, which will be decided by the judiciary.  
    o Legislative power of depriving a person’s liberty is restricted and scrutinized and  
    evaluated by the judiciary.
-   In India, a person’s life and liberty shall be deprived according to the “procedure  
    established by law”.  
    o The word “procedure established by law” gives wide discretionary power to the  
    legislature to restrict the liberty.  
    o Nevertheless, the Supreme Court in Maneka Gandhi case (even though the court did  
    not use the word due process) held that the procedure established by law must be fair,  
    just and equitable.
-   The Indian Parliament deleted the Right to Property from the list of Fundamental Rights in
    1978.  Whereas, in US, the right to property is still a fundamental right and no property shall  
        be acquired without just compensation.

-   A person accused of crime enjoys certain explicit rights under the 6th Amendment to the US Student Notes:^  
    Constitution: speedy and public trial, notice of accusation, compulsory process of obtaining  
    witness in his favor and assistance of legal counsel of his choice.  
    o All these rights in India are not expressly mentioned in the Constitution. Nonetheless,  
    these rights are provided by the Supreme Court by broadly interpreting the Right to Life  
    and Liberty under Article 21.
-   Further, the 8th amendment to the US Constitution says that bail shall not be denied to an  
    accused, the imposed fine should not be excessive and inflicted punishment shall not be  
    cruel. These rights are also made available to Indian people because of well-established  
    precedents pronounced by the Supreme Court under Article 21.
-   9 th amendment to the US Constitution is quite important because it says that mere  
    enumeration of certain rights in the Constitution shall not be interpreted to deny the other  
    rights retained by the American people. In spite of the statutory rights in the Constitution  
    people enjoy other rights, which are given by nature. The American Constitution is highly  
    influenced by Locke’s philosophy of inalienable natural rights of human being. The Indian  
    Constitution, on the other hand, does not contain any such notable Article. Therefore,  
    Indians enjoy only those rights recognized by the Constitution, which are based on the  
    philosophy of Austin and Bentham’s theory of law.

### 3.9. Distribution of Legislative Power

#### 3.9.1. India............................................................................................................................

Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution distributes the legislative power between the  
Central and State governments. The Central and State governments have exclusive power to  
make laws on 9 8 and 59 subjects, listed in the Union and State list respectively. On the 52  
matters of Concurrent list both the Centre and State can make laws. In case of conflicting laws,  
law of the Centre would prevail.

97 th subject in the Union list says that any subject, which does not belong to any other list  
would automatically confer power to the Parliament to make a law regarding that subject.  
Thus, our constitution makers have created stronger Central and weaker State governments,  
which depend on the Central government for the financial assistance.

#### 3.9.2. US

It is quite contrary in the case of US, where no elaborative mechanism is provided. Few  
expressly mentioned subjects are with the federal and rest of the matters with State  
governments.

### 3.11. Judiciary 3.10. Emergency and Suspension of Writs 20 Student Notes:

In India, an emergency can be declared on the ground of War and Armed Rebellion. During such  
emergency all fundamental rights except the right to life can be suspended. The American  
Constitution does not use the phrase of emergency but says that in case of Rebellion and  
Invasion of Public Safety, the writ of Habeas Corpus can be suspended.

### 3 .11. Judiciary

There is no qualification mentioned for the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court.  
In America, the President has the final say in the appointment of Supreme Court Judges. He  
suggests the names of judges to the Senate and on the advice and consent of the Senate,  
judges are appointed by the President. The Judicial Committee of Senate plays a very significant  
role in evaluating the credentials of the proposed judges of the Supreme Court. They make the  
investigation of the background of judges, they hold a face-to-face interaction with the judges,  
the judges are queered and grilled and questions are put. The whole process happens in public  
and in a transparent manner. If a citizen of the US has any information about judges’ integrity,

he can send that information, with evidence, to the Senate Judicial Committee, which further Student Notes:  
investigates to ensure that no unworthy candidate is appointed as a Judge to the Supreme  
Court. In the appointment of Judges the people of US also participate and the judiciary of US  
has no role to play in the appointment of judges. The entire process of appointment of judges is  
crystal clear.

There is no fixed tenure of the judges. However, if they are retiring at the age of 70 years, they  
will get salary and perks as a working judge.

India, on the other hand, has the collegium system of appointment and transfer of judges of the  
higher judiciary. While, the collegium system has been criticized on the grounds that it is non-  
transparent, the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act passed by the  
Parliament to change the collegium system was struck down by the judiciary as  
unconstitutional.

### 3.12. Amendment of the Constitution

There are two ways to amend the Constitution:

-   Proposed by the Congress and ratified by the States  
    o Amendment to be passed by 2/3rd majority in both the Houses  
    o To be ratified by the State Legislatures of at least 3/4th of the States
-   Proposed by States and ratified by the States  
    o 2/3rd of the States should pass a resolution to this effect  
    o They will communicate to the Congress. The Congress will call the convention.  
    o In the convention, it has to be ratified by 3/4th of the States

In case of India, the amendment process is easy and flexible as compared to the US. In India, it  
is only the Parliament that can propose an amendment to the Constitution and States do not  
have any role to play in this matter. While some of the Articles can be amended by a simple  
majority, special majority is required for others, and in some limited Articles, ratification by  
more than half of the States is also required. Majority here means majority of the Members of  
the Parliament present on the date of the amendment, and is not related to the total strength  
of the Parliament.

The fact that the US Constitution got amended only 27 times in the last 225 years, shows how  
rigid it is to amend the US Constitution, in contrast to the Indian Constitution.

## 4\. Chinese Constitution

China is a socialist country. There is supremacy of socialist ideology in China. The Chinese  
Constitution accepts the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC).

Communist Party of China (CPC) is the largest political party in the world, having millions of  
local level members. It works on the principle of Democratic Centralism. The full meeting of the  
party is called as National Party Congress (NPC), which is convened once in five years. Though  
theoretically all power lies with the people, but in practice, it is with the top leaders.

NPC members select the members of the Central Committee. The Central Committee selects  
the Polit Bureau (around 200 members). The Polit Bureau selects the Standing Committee of  
the Polit Bureau (at present 24 members; the most powerful members of the party).

### 4.1. Salient Features of the Constitution

#### 4.1.1. Preamble

The paramount position of Marxism, Leninism and Mao’s teachings has been acknowledged in  
relation to ideological goals of the political system. Traditional principle of Democratic  
Centralism has also been given due place within the Constitutional setup. The old definition of

```

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

China as a “Dictatorship of the Proletariat” has been replaced with “People’s Democratic Student Notes:  
Dictatorship.”

The Preamble clearly recognizes Taiwan as an integral part of China and its liberation is declared  
as a liability of Chinese People. Five points have been set as the underlying principles to be  
observed in the field of foreign relations. These include:

a) Respect and Preservation of the territorial integrity of all nations  
b) Avoidance of aggression  
c) Non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries  
d) Promotion of international cooperation  
e) Peaceful coexistence

#### 4.1.2. Nature of Constitution

It has close affinity in letter and spirit, with the constitution of the former Soviet Union. It is  
neither too rigid nor too flexible.

#### 4.1.3. Basic Principles

Under the Constitution, People’s Republic of China is a Socialist State established in the name of  
People’s Democratic dictatorship, wherein Communist Party performs a leadership role to guide  
the people. People are declared as fountain of power and authority and they will exercise it  
through National People’s Congress.

#### 4.1.4. Unitary System

The People's Republic of China is a unitary multi-national state created jointly by the people of  
all its nationalities.

In China, a strong central government exists while regional governments, as distinct entities,  
have not been created under the Constitution. Therefore, In order to encourage people’s  
participation in policy-making and preserve their interest in public affairs, decentralization has  
been introduced in the governmental affairs. The central government has delegated much  
authority and powers to the regional and local administrative units.

#### 4.1.5. Democratic Centralism

Like the political system of former Soviet Union, the principle of “Democratic Centralism”  
prevails in People’s Republic of China as well. Keeping in view democratic norms, elective  
principle has been introduced at all levels not only within the governmental institutions but also  
within the Party organization. All the citizens have been secured the right to vote on the basis of  
adult suffrage.

#### 4.1.6. One Party System

-   The Communist Party enjoys almost dictatorial powers within the constitutional framework  
    and has been regarded as the sole source of political authority for all practical purposes.
-   Party organization runs parallel to that of the governmental institutions. Party elite hold all  
    top-notch positions in the government.
-   In practice, no other political party enjoys real freedom to act.  
    o Certain youth organizations, loyal to the party and working groups affiliated with the  
    Party, enjoy the right to participate in decision-making.

#### 4.1.7. Legislature

-   The **National People’s Congress (NPC)** comprises the legislative branch.
-   It is a unicameral legislature with more than 3000 members.
-   Theoretically, it is the top decision making body in China. It has the ultimate say on policies,  
    amendments and appointment of ministers in the government.

-   It has been declared as an organ through which the people exercise state power. Student Notes:^
-   Congressmen are elected by regional Congresses, by autonomous regions, by Municipalities  
    working under the central government and by People’s Liberation Army, each according to  
    its quota.
-   The mode of election is based on secret ballot, while the constitution guarantees holding of  
    free and fair elections.
-   The real work of NPC is done by a smaller body known as Standing Committee of NPC,  
    consisting around 150 members.

**_Duration_**

The Congressmen are elected for a period of five years but the Congress can be dissolved  
before the expiry of its term and it can be extended as well. The Standing Committee of the  
Congress is responsible for making proper arrangements for holding fresh elections prior to the  
completion of its term.

**Sessions**

Sessions of the Congress are held once a year in Beijing. The Standing Committee of the  
Congress normally summons its session. In addition to it, the Chairman of the Congress can also  
summon the session on the request of one fifth of its members.

**Powers**

The National People’s Congress (NPC) is the supreme law-making body, which is fully authorized  
to enact laws, alter or repeal the existing ones. It also approves the administrative policy for the  
state.

1.  **Enactment of Laws**  
    During its sessions, the Congress enacts new laws and makes necessary alterations in the  
    existing ones, if circumstances so demand. The Constitution can be amended with the  
    support of two-thirds majority of the members of the Congress, whereas ordinary laws are  
    enacted by a simple majority. It is to be noted, that the acts of the Congress cannot be  
    challenged in the Supreme Court.
2.  **Executive Powers**  
    National People’s Congress is also empowered under the Constitution, to supervise the  
    execution of constitutional laws and statutes. It can affect and control administrative  
    policies through its choice regarding the appointment of superior public officials. All the  
    administrative departments along with their ministers in charge are accountable to the  
    Congress in respect of performing their official functions. Congress also exercises the power  
    to approve National Economic Policy and the annual budget. Congress is fully authorized  
    under the constitution to exercise all such powers as it thinks expedient and necessary  
    within its sphere of action.
3.  **Elective functions**  
    NPC holds a pivotal position within governmental structure by virtue of its power to elect  
    the top-notch occupants of the governmental authority. Under the Constitution, it also  
    elects the President and Vice President of the Republic and appoints Premier of the State  
    Council on the recommendation of the President. On the advice of the Premier, it also  
    appoints other ministers. Congress is also empowered to remove the ministers. It also  
    exercises the power to appoint or remove the President of the Supreme Court and Chief  
    Procurator of the Supreme Procurate.  
    Though the NPC is fully authorized by the Constitution to exercise all the foregoing powers,  
    in practice, it is not an active body. Rather its position, as a free law-making body is merely  
    in theory. Major reasons being:
    -   Its sessions are rarely held on a regular basis.  
        o It meets only once a year, that too for not more than a few days.
    -   The powers of Congress are virtually exercised by its Standing Committee.

**Standing Committee** Student Notes:

The Standing Committee of the Congress is an effective and active body, as it exercises, in  
practice, most of the Congressional powers. It is outwardly a body subordinate to the Congress,  
as a matter of principle. It is accountable to the parent body and is bound to present regular  
reports of its working. All the members of the Committee are elected by the Congress and liable  
to be removed on its discretion.

**Powers**

**1.** The Committee summons the sessions of the Congress, in addition to the issuance of orders  
to hold its fresh elections.  
**2.** It performs the function of interpreting the statutes as well as the laws of the Constitution.  
The performance of this judicial type of function enhances its importance and the scope of  
power.  
**3.** It supervises the functioning of the State Council, of superior courts and that of Procurator.  
These functions have been assigned to the Standing Committee by the Constitution.  
**4.** The Committee has the authority to alter or repeal any inappropriate decision of the official  
departments, autonomous regions, provinces and that of the Municipalities working under  
the Central government.  
**5.** It is actually the repository of real powers during the interval in which the Congress is out of  
session. During this period, it wields the authority to issue orders regarding the  
appointment of new ministers and removal of the previous ones, on the advice of the  
Premier. It can issue orders for the appointment or removal of the Vice President as well as  
the Deputy Chief Procurator.

**_Chairman_**

The Chairman of the Committee has been regarded as the most powerful person in the political  
setup. He presides over the meetings of the Standing Committee. He has also been endowed  
with the power to issue decrees and promulgate ordinances. His list of duties include:

-   To receive the diplomatic envoys of other countries;
-   Ratification of the treaties made with other countries; and
-   Appointment of the members of diplomatic corpse assigned to other countries.

**_Other Committees_**

The People’s Congress forms a number of Committees during its term, such as National  
Committee on fiscal and economic affairs, Committee on education, science, culture and health  
issues, Committee on foreign affairs, Committee on matters relating to Chinese settled abroad.  
All these committees work under the supervision of the Standing Committee of National  
People’s Congress during the period the latter is not in session.

Keeping in view the aforesaid functions and powers of the Standing Committee, it is apparent  
that it is a powerful and effective body. As the Congressional annual session lasts a few days  
only, its powers are virtually exercised by the Standing Committee for the remaining period the  
parent body is not in session. The Committee’s members, being the members of the Chinese  
Communist Party, perform important role in administrative affairs as well.

An overview of the structure of legislative and executive arm of the government is given below: Student Notes:

#### 4.1.8. Executive

#### State Council

The State Council is the Cabinet or Executive of China. It is headed by the Premier, four Vice  
Premiers and State Councillors. Under the Constitution, State Council is the chief executive  
organ of the government. All its members are elected by the Congress and accountable to it.  
Enforcement of law, formation and execution of the administrative policy is the major function  
of the Council. The members of the State Council introduce the bills on the floor of the  
Congress in the form of proposals and later manage to get these translated into law on  
parliamentary lines.

#### Premier

The Premier performs a very important role as head of the administration and holds a pivotal  
position within the administrative set up.

#### President

-   The President of the Republic is regarded as head of the state.
-   He is elected by the Congress for a period of five years.
-   The President enjoys the most prestigious position in the administrative setup.

Under the country's constitution, the presidency is a largely ceremonial office with limited  
powers.^ However, since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held  
simultaneously by General Secretary of Communist Party of China and also the president will be  
automatically head of the military. The office is officially regarded as an institution of the  
state rather than an administrative post. Theoretically, the President serves at the pleasure of  
the National People's Congress, and is not legally vested to take executive action on its own  
prerogative.

The President has the power to promulgate laws, select and dismiss Premier as well as ministers Student Notes:  
of the State Council, grant presidential pardons, declare a state of emergency, issue mass  
mobilization orders, and issue state honors. In addition, President names and dismisses  
ambassadors to foreign countries, signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to  
the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the National  
People's Congress.

The President must be a Chinese citizen with full electoral rights who has reached the age of 45.  
Until 2018, President and Vice-President had two term limit. National People's Congress in  
March, 2018 passed a constitutional amendment removing presidential term limits,  
allowing the current president and vice-president to remain in office indefinitely. The limit of  
two five-year presidential terms was written into China’s constitution after Mao Zedong’s death  
in 1976. The system was enacted by Deng Xiaoping, who recognized the dangers of one-man  
rule and the cult of personality and instead espoused collective leadership. This constitutional  
revision also enshrines current President Xi Jinping’s ideology as “Xi Jinping thought” alongside  
“scientific development” theory of his predecessor Hu Jintao.

#### 4.1.9. Judiciary

China has a committed Judiciary, i.e. committed to the goal of Socialism. The highest organ is  
the Supreme People’s Court. China also has a Court of Procuratorates – it deals with corruption  
cases of officials.

Chinese law has never been codified in a systematic form. Most of the disputes and  
controversies are settled in quasi-judicial institutions. The Chinese judicial system has been held  
together more by conventions, rather than by laws.

#### 4.1.10. Central Military Commission

-   The party and the government maintain control on the military through the Central Military  
    Commission
-   Military is also described as the defenders of the Communist Party.

#### 4.1.11. Rights and Duties

**_Rights_**

-   The Chinese Constitution gives Fundamental Rights and prescribes certain duties for its  
    citizens.
-   All citizens at least 18 years of age are secured the right to vote. They also enjoy the right to  
    contest elections. Right to secrecy of all correspondence, freedom of speech and  
    expression, freedom to join or form associations, and right to hold public meetings even to  
    the extent of staging demonstration or resorting to strike for articulation of demands, have  
    been secured under the Constitution.
-   According to the constitution, the government is under obligation to afford full protection  
    to the preservation of family life in addition to the integrity of a person. All citizens have the  
    right to personal security against illegal detention. The constitution also recognizes equal  
    right of all citizens to education and cultural freedom. Equality of men and women has also  
    been recognized in all areas of life.

**Duties**

The Chinese constitution explicitly prescribes certain duties of the citizens, which are  
justiciable. It is the first and foremost duty of the citizens to cooperate with the Socialist  
leadership in every respect, abide by the Constitution and all other state laws. They are  
required to protect public property and extend a helping hand in the maintenance of law and  
order. To defend the country against foreign aggression is also another duty of the citizens.

#### 4 .1.12. Communist Party of China Student Notes:^

The Chinese Communist Party came into being in 1921. Lenin sent one representative to China  
to assist in organizing the newly established party. Cheng Tu-hisu was appointed as the first  
Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party and within a short period many branches of  
the Party were established in the towns and cities.

**Ideological Foundations**

Ideology of the Chinese Communist Party had been shaped by the teachings of Marx and Lenin  
right from its inception. It developed a deep linkage with the global Communist Movement in  
its early phase. Mao also played a pivotal role in the socialist struggle of the Chinese People.

**Party Organization**

The party operates on the principle of Democratic Centralism. Accordingly all office bearers of  
the Party are elected. Primary unit of the Party elects District Congress while District Congress  
elects the deputies of the Congress of the upper level.

Party members enjoy right to criticize party leadership and may initiate proposals for framing  
party policies. On the same pattern, primary party branches may lodge complaints for the  
consideration of higher leadership.

On the other hand, strict party discipline is maintained and strong centralism operates in the  
decision-making process. It is obligatory on the lower ranked party members to abide by the  
decisions of the higher ranked party leadership. In practice, most of the decisions are thrust  
upon by the higher ranks within the central leadership.

**Politburo**

The Politburo has been regarded as the most powerful body in the decision-making process, as  
it makes all-important decisions; so much so that it summons the sessions of the Central  
Committee. It also has a Standing Committee consisting of seven members. Like its counterpart  
within the government, the Standing Committee of the Politburo exercises all the powers of the  
Central Committee when the latter is not in session.

**National Congress of the Communist Party of Congress**

National Congress of the Communist Party of Congress holds a pivotal position in the policy-  
making of the Party. Members of the Congress numbering in thousands with no fixed size are  
elected by the respective regional and local party congresses for a period of five years.

**Central Committee**

The National Congress of the Communist Party of Congress holds its sessions for a few days,  
once every five years. The Central Executive Committee, comprising limited membership,  
exercises the power of the Congress when the latter is not in session. The powers of the Central  
Executive Committee are also exercised in practice, by its Politburo, as the former rarely holds  
its meetings. The Central Committee elects the members of its Politburo, as well as its  
Chairman and Vice Chairman.

**Other Parties and Groups**

Single party system, on the lines of Soviet Union, has not been adopted in the People’s Republic  
of China; rather such smaller parties, as Kumintang Revolutionary Committee, Democratic  
League, National Construction Association and various Youth Organizations are allowed to  
function. Hence, China is a multi-national and multi-party country. In China, the term  
democratic parties refer to the eight other parties apart from the Chinese Communist Party.  
These have developed cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party on different levels, since  
the inception of the new order.

But, the Communist Party enjoys political monopoly in China, while other parties have merely  
dejure existence. Party Organization runs parallel to that of the government. A person holding

important position as a public official is also assigned office within the Party. The Central Student Notes:  
leadership of the Party is mainly responsible for chalking out government policies. The  
importance of any government department can’t be assessed keeping in view merely its legal  
status, since its role within the Party matters.

## 5\. French Constitution

### 5.1. Introduction

-   France is known as ‘Laboratory of Political experiment’.
-   It has a unitary form of government and nature of the government is called as semi-  
    Presidential type
-   It has some features of Parliamentary system and others of Presidential system
-   The French Parliament does not have supremacy even in law making. There is a list for  
    which the legislature can make laws, whereas rest of the matters are taken care of by the  
    President (i.e. he makes the laws).
-   This is perhaps the only Democratic Constitution based on the Principle of Supremacy of  
    Executive.
-   France suffered from political instability. Hence, the Constitution of the 5th Republic  
    provides a strong President, with a fixed term of 5 years, and he enjoys a lot of powers.

### 5.2. President

-   The French President is the most powerful within the French system as well as amongst all  
    other executive across world democracies
-   Privileges of the Office of the President of US, i.e. security of tenure and being the head of  
    the Government as well as head of the State is combined with the privileges of the Office of  
    the British P.M. i.e. power to dissolve the Assembly (which the American President doesn’t  
    enjoy)
-   France has PM as well as President  
    o French PM, unlike that in India and Britain, is assistant to the President  
    o There is a division of functions, rather than division of power between the two  
    positions  
    ▪ The French President deals with foreign policy and national concerns  
    ▪ The PM, on the other hand, deals with day to day routine functions of the  
    Government and local domestic issues
-   PM is appointed by the President  
    o The President doesn’t have a completely free-hand in PM’s election  
    o The person appointed as PM must enjoy the confidence of the House
-   Concept of **_‘Cohabitation’_**  
    o A situation where the President and the PM belong to different political parties
-   PM may choose his cabinet colleagues
-   None of the members of the Govt. can be a part of the legislature
-   Cabinet is presided over by the President
-   The Lower House can pass the ‘Censure Motion’ against the PM and his CoM, which would  
    imply that they must resign
-   The President is elected for a fixed term. Initially the term was 9 years, reduced to 7 years  
    and at present is 5 years.
-   They follow Second Ballot system (i.e. absolute majority of the total votes polled is needed)  
    o The President of the Republic shall be elected by an absolute majority of votes polled: if  
    in the first round of elections, no person gets absolute majority only the top two  
    candidates remain and the rest are eliminated. Second round of election takes place, in  
    which one person is able to get the absolute majority.

**_Removal of the President_** Student Notes:

-   The President can be impeached on the same ground as the US President. However, the  
    process is ambiguous.
-   Article 67 of the Constitution suggests that both the Houses should pass identical motion.
-   After this, the President’s case will be dealt with by a special body called the High Court of  
    Justice.
-   This body also trails cases of corruption and conspiracies against the state by government  
    ministries.

**_Emergency Powers of the President_**

Article 16 of the Constitution gives the real emergency powers to the President. In this situation  
he assumes unlimited powers and it is like democratic dictatorship or democratic coup-detat.

**_Comparative Analysis of the US and French Presidents_**

-   The US President cannot dissolve the Assembly, whereas the French President can do so.  
    The only limitation is that he can’t do so more than twice a year.
-   Unlike the US President, the French President can assume dictatorial powers under Article
    

**_Comparative Analysis of the French President and British P.M._**

-   The British P.M. can remain in office only as long as he enjoys majority in the lower house.  
    The President of France, on the other hand, is elected for a fixed term.

### 5.3. The Legislature

The Legislature is clearly subordinate to the Executive in the French system. Article 37 of the  
Constitution puts clear limitation on the legislative power of the French Parliament. It mentions  
that the Parliament can make laws only on the matters enumerated in the Constitution. On all  
other matters, the government can make laws by simple order or decree.

The President can directly influence the legislative functions of the assembly through the P.M. If  
the assembly doesn’t agree to a particular bill, it can be given for referendum by the President.

The French Parliament is bicameral, consisting of two houses: National Assembly and the  
Senate

#### 5.3.1. National Assembly......................................................................................................

As is the case with other bicameral Parliaments, the French bicameralism is an unequal system  
since the National Assembly has much broader powers than those of the Senate:

-   It alone can hold the Government accountable by refusing to grant it ‘confidence’ or by  
    passing a censure motion (following the same idea, only the National Assembly can be  
    dissolved by the President of the Republic).
-   In the case of disagreement with the Senate, the Government can decide to grant the  
    National Assembly “the final say” in the legislative procedure (except for constitutional acts  
    and institutional acts concerning the Senate);
-   The Constitution provides the National Assembly with a more important role in the  
    examination of the finance bill and the social security financing bill. Thus, the tabling for a  
    first reading of such bills must be before the National Assembly and the time limits granted  
    for their examination are much longer for the National Assembly.

#### 5.3.2. The Senate

In contrast to the National Assembly, the Senate cannot be dissolved. The fact that Senate is a  
permanent body plays an important role in accounting for the stability of the Government  
when the post of the French Republic’s President falls vacant. Owing to above, it’s the President

of the Senate who is appointed the President of French Republic if the latter is prevented from Student Notes:  
doing so, if he falls ill or resigns. Thus, a case of power vacuum is prevented, in case the  
President’s office falls vacant.

This interim is limited to the time needed to organize a presidential election (in practice, it lasts  
around 50 days).

### 5.4. Prominent Features of the French Constitution

-   **Organic Law** : An organic or fundamental law is one that forms the foundation of a  
    government or organization. A Constitution is a particular form of organic law for a  
    sovereign state. The French Constitution has certain laws mentioned as organic laws. Laws  
    made by the Parliament and the orders of the Executive must confirm to the Organic laws.  
    So these laws have to be reviewed by a body known as the Constitutional Council. It has 9  
    members – three are representatives of the President, three are representatives of the  
    French National Assembly, and the remaining three are representatives of the Senate.
-   **High Council of Justice** : The purpose is the nomination of the judges. This body is headed  
    by the President and the members of the Judiciary. The President is also known as the  
    ‘guardian of Judiciary’.
-   **Economic and Social Council** : Constitutional advisory body on social and economic issues.
-   **Secularism** : France follows the rigid principle of secularism unlike Indian secularism which  
    respects all religions equally. The French model of secularism follows the principle of strict  
    separation of Church and State, freedom of conscience and freedom to exercise any faith.  
    The state does not support religious activities but also not interfere in private religious  
    practices. It prohibits any visible religious symbols in public space. This model leaves no  
    scope for the idea of the state-supported religious reforms.

### 5.5. Amendment of the Constitution

-   Rigid process
-   Both the Houses of Parliament have to pass a resolution by 3/5th majority.
-   The President may also choose to refer the amendment to people by referendum.

## 6\. Germany’s Constitution

-   Germany is a federation and the residuary powers in Germany lie with the states.
-   The states are referred to as ‘Landers’.
-   It has a Parliamentary form of Government, modeled on the British Parliamentary form. But  
    it is not just a replicate of the system.
-   Germany is called as ‘Chancellor’s Democracy’.
-   Chancellor is the PM.
-   President is the Constitutional Head.

### 6.1. Salient Features

#### 6.1.1. Chancellor’s Democracy

-   The Chancellor has a clear-cut superiority over other Ministers.
-   Chancellor Principle: Chancellor has a privilege to determine the broad policy and other  
    ministers are expected to act as per these guidelines. While a minister works under these  
    guidelines, he enjoys a lot of autonomy with respect to his department.

This mechanism ensures the stability of the coalition government.

#### 6.1.2. Cabinet Principle

It comes into existence only when there is a dispute among different departments. In such a  
situation decision is taken collectively.

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

#### 6 .1.3. Constructive Vote of No-Confidence Student Notes:^

-   The motion of no-confidence against the Chancellor is permitted only when those bringing  
    the notion can prove that they are in a position to form an alternative government.
-   This is also to deal with the problems of Hung Assembly (Coalition Government)

#### 6.1.4. Parliament

Germany has two houses: The Bundestag and The Bundesrat

#### The Bundestag

The lower house in the German political system is the Bundestag. Its members are elected for a  
four-year term. The method of election is known as Mixed Member Proportional  
Representation (MMPR), a more complicated system than First-Past-The-Post (FPTP), but one  
which gives a more proportional result (a variant of this system known as the additional

#### member system is used for the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly).

**_Manner of Elections_**

Half of the members of the Bundestag are elected directly from 299 constituencies using the  
first-past-the post method of election. The other half – another 299 - are elected from the list of  
the parties on the basis of each Land (the 16 regions that make up Germany).

-   The people cast two votes: one for a candidate in their constituency and one for a political  
    party. The process is called a personalized proportional representation system. Simply put,  
    Germans vote to decide how the 598 base seats in the Bundestag will be divided among  
    members of Germany’s various political parties.
-   “The Germans are all about proportion,” said Jackson Janes, president of the American  
    Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University. “The two votes  
    boil down to what’s their favorite guy who represents them in their districts and what’s  
    their favorite team that will represent them in the Bundestag.”
-   The first vote, on the left side of the ballot, is a direct vote for a member of parliament in  
    that constituency, similar to Americans voting for a congressional reprentative in their  
    district. There are 299 constituencies in Germany, so direct votes make up roughly half of  
    the seats in the Bundestag.
-   The second vote, on the right side of the ballot, is for a political party. Parties in Germany’s  
    16 states put together lists of candidates; the results from the second votes determine  
    which candidates make it off the lists to the remaining 299 seats in parliament. Parties need  
    to receive at least 5 percent of the second votes in a state to qualify for a seat.

The system starts to get complicated when Germans split their votes, meaning they vote for a  
candidate from one party in the first vote and for a different political party in their second vote.  
That can throw off the balance of seats in parliament so that one party is more strongly  
represented than they should be based on the results of the proportionate second votes.

So Germans created **“overhang” and “balance seats.”** Those are extra seats in the Bundestag  
that ensure every candidate who was directly elected gets a seat while political parties are still  
proportionally represented based on the number of votes they received. A German state’s  
population is taken into consideration when votes are converted into seats.

#### Reason behind adopting the above Election System

This system is designed to block membership of the Bundestag to small, extremist parties. As a  
consequence, there are always a small number of parties with representation in the Bundestag.

_Comparative analysis of Bundestag_

One striking difference when comparing the Bundestag with the American Congress or the  
British House of Commons is the lack of time spent on serving constituents in Germany.

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

This is so because: Student Notes:

-   Only 50% of Bundestag members are directly elected to represent a specific geographical  
    district.
-   A serving constituency seems not to be perceived, either by the electorate or by the  
    representatives, as a critical function of the legislator.
-   There is also a practical constraint on the expansion of constituent service in the form of a  
    limited personal staff of Bundestag members (especially compared to members of the US  
    Congress).

#### The Bundesrat

The upper house in the German political system is the Bundesrat.

At a first glance, the composition of the Bundesrat looks similar to other upper houses in  
federal states such as the US Congress, since the Bundestag is a body representing all the  
German Lander (or regional states). However, there are two fundamental differences in the  
German system:

**1.** Its members are not elected (neither by popular vote nor by the State Parliaments). They  
are members of the State Cabinets, which appoint them and can remove them at any time.  
Normally, a state delegation is headed by the head of government in the Land, known in  
Germany as the Minister-President.  
**2.** The States are not represented by an equal number of delegates, since the population of  
the respective state is a major factor in the allocation of votes (rather than delegates) to  
each particular Land. The vote allocation can be approximated as 2.01 + the square root of  
the Land's population in millions with the additional limit of a maximum of six votes so that  
it is consistent with something called the Penrose method based on game theory. This  
means that the 16 states have between three and six delegates.

This unusual method of composition provides for a total of 69 votes (not seats) in the  
Bundesrat. The State Cabinet may then appoint as many delegates as the state has votes, but is  
under no obligation to do so; it can restrict the state delegation even to one single delegate.  
The number of members or delegates representing a particular Land does not matter formally,  
since in stark contrast to many other legislative bodies, the delegates to the Bundesrat from any  
one state are required to cast the votes of the state as a bloc (since the votes are not those of  
the respective delegate). This means that in practice it is possible (and quite customary) that  
only one of the delegates (the _Stimmführer_ or "leader of the votes" - normally the Minister-  
President) casts all the votes of the respective state, even if the other members of the  
delegation are present in the chamber.

Even with a full delegate appointment of 69, the Bunsderat is a much smaller body than the  
Bundestag with over 600 members. It is unusual for the two chambers of a bicameral system to  
be quite so unequal in size. But the Bundesrat has the power to veto a legislation that affects  
the powers of the states.

## 7\. Constitution of Japan

-   Japan has a Parliamentary system of Government.
-   It has a constitutional Monarchy  
    o King is more like a ‘Rubber stamp’ authority while PM is head of the Cabinet
-   Election of the PM  
    o PM is elected by both the Houses of Japanese Parliament (called Diet).  
    o The two houses of the Diet are:  
    ▪ House of Representatives; and  
    ▪ House of Councillors

-   A significant feature of Japanese Constitution is contained in Article 9.  
    o Herein, Japan formally renounces the policy of war for the settlement of international  
    disputes. However, it can keep forces for self-defence.

## 8\. Constitution of Canada

#### The Canadian Constitution encompasses a wide set of principles and values that govern

#### key political relations in the Canadian society.

### 8.1. Salient Features

#### 8.1.1. Constitutional Monarchy............................................................................................

-   It is the central component of Canada’s constitutional framework.
-   The _Constitution Act, 1867_ states that executive government and authority in Canada is  
    vested in the **Canadian Monarchy** (which Canada shares with Great Britain and some other  
    former British colonies). The British Queen is the formal head of the state.  
    o The Act further provides for the offices of the **Governor General of Canada** (at the  
    federal level) and **Lieutenant Governors** (at the provincial level), recognized as the  
    Monarch’s representatives in Canada.
-   It is important to note, however, that while the written constitution explicitly places  
    executive authority in the hands of the Monarch and his/her representatives, the unwritten  
    constitutional convention holds that this authority is actually exercised by the Prime  
    Minister and his/her Cabinet.

#### 8.1.2. Parliamentary Government

The Canadian Constitution also provides for a Parliamentary system of government.

**_Features of Parliamentary Government as given in Constitution Act, 1867:_**

-   The Act established a federal Parliament, consisting of the Monarchy and two legislative  
    chambers, the **House of Commons** (or Lower House) and the **Senate** (or Upper House).
-   The Act further states that the powers and authority of these legislative chambers are to be  
    modeled upon those found in the British Parliament.
-   Further, the Act also established legislative chambers at the provincial level.

In addition to the written provisions of the Act, there also exist several unwritten constitution  
conventions that are fundamental to the operation of Canada’s parliamentary system. These  
include **executive dominance by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet** (at the federal level) and  
by **the Premier and the Cabinet** (at the provincial level), as well as the practice of **responsible  
government**.

#### The House of Commons

In the Canadian political system, the lower chamber is the House of Commons, which takes its  
name from the lower house in the British political system. The Commons consists of 308  
members known as - like their British counterparts - Members of Parliament (MPs).

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

**_Manner of Election_** Student Notes:

Members are elected by the first-past-the-post system (as in Britain) in each of the country's  
electoral districts, which are colloquially known as _ridings_ (known as ‘constituencies’ in Britain).  
Seats in the House of Commons are distributed roughly in proportion to the population of each  
province and territory, but some ridings are more populous than others and the Canadian  
constitution contains some special provisions regarding provincial representation.

**_Term and Tenure_**

The maximum term of MPs is four years, but it is common for a general election to be called  
earlier.

**_Powers_**

As in the British political model, the House of Commons is much the more powerful of the two  
chambers. Although all legislation has to be approved by both chambers, in practice the will of  
the elected House usually prevails over that of the appointed Senate. The processes and  
conventions of the Commons reflect very much those of its British namesake.

#### The Senate

In the Canadian political system, the upper chamber is the Senate, which takes its name from  
the upper house in the American political system.

The Senate consists of 105 members, appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the  
Prime Minister. Seats are assigned on a regional basis, with each of the four major regions  
receiving 24 seats, and the remaining nine seats being assigned to smaller regions.

#### 8.1.3. Federalism

The Constitution also provides for a **federal system** in Canada, meaning there are two key levels  
of government: the **federal (or national) government** and the **provincial (or regional)  
governments**. Canada is a federation with a strong Centre, wherein residuary powers lie with  
the Centre.

The _Constitution Act, 1867_ outlines specific powers and jurisdictions for each of these levels of  
government, such as what public policy fields each may legislate in, as well as how each level of  
the government may raise revenue. Over the years, these constitutional provisions have been  
further clarified and evolved by judicial decisions (first by the British Judicial Committee of the  
Privy Council, and later by the Supreme Court of Canada).

**_Changes in the nature of Canadian Federalism_**

There have also been several constitutional amendments that have had significant  
consequences for Canada’s federal system. Over the years there has been a shift towards giving  
greater powers to the states.

For example, the _Constitution Act, 1930_ , transferred ownership of natural resources in Western  
Canada from the federal government to the Western provinces. Another significant amendment  
was the _Constitution Act, 1982_ , which committed the federal government and provinces to  
ensuring some level of economic and social equality between Canadian regions. This, in turn,  
has led to the development of the Equalization Program and the sharing of public funds  
between governments.

#### 8.1.4. Judiciary

The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court and final authority on civil, criminal and  
constitutional matters.

The court's nine members are appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Prime  
Minister and the Minister of Justice. They serve until the age of 75.

Each province operates its own individual court system. The country's legal system is based Student Notes:  
mainly on English common law, but in the province of Québec, it is modeled on French civil law.

#### 8.1.5. Rights

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is a bill of rights entrenched in the Constitution  
of Canada, which forms the first part of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Charter guarantees  
certain political rights to Canadian citizens and civil rights of everyone in Canada. The Charter  
applies to government laws and actions (including the laws and actions of federal, provincial,  
and municipal governments and public school boards), and sometimes to the common law, but  
not to private activity.

The courts, when confronted with violations of Charter rights, have struck down as  
unconstitutional, federal and provincial statutes and regulations in whole or in part.

## 9\. Constitution of Australia

Australia’s system of government is founded in the liberal democratic tradition. Based on the  
values of religious tolerance, freedom of speech and association, and the rule of law, Australia’s  
institutions and practices of government reflect British and North American models. At the  
same time, they are uniquely Australian.

-   Australian federation is modeled on the US federation. For example, residuary powers are  
    with the states, Governors of the states are elected by the people and formally appointed  
    by the British Queen.
-   In Australia, there has been a growth of Cooperative Federalism.

### 9.1. Salient Features

#### 9.1.1. Form of Government

One of the oldest continuous democracies in the world, the Commonwealth of Australia was  
created in 1901, when the former British colonies—now the six states—agreed to federate. The  
democratic practices and principles that shaped the pre-federation colonial Parliaments (such  
as ‘one man, one vote’ and women’s suffrage) were adopted by Australia’s first federal  
government.

The Australian Constitution sets out the powers of government in three separate chapters—the  
legislature, the executive and the judiciary—but insists that members of the legislature must  
also be members of the executive. In practice, Parliament delegates wide regulatory powers to  
the executive.

The popularly elected Parliament consists of two chambers: the House of Representatives and  
the Senate. Ministers appointed from these Chambers conduct executive government, and  
policy decisions are made in Cabinet meetings. Apart from the announcement of decisions,  
Cabinet discussions are not disclosed. Ministers are bound by the principle of Cabinet solidarity,  
which closely mirrors the British model of Cabinet government responsible to the Parliament.

Although, Australia is an independent nation, Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain is also formally  
the Queen of Australia. The Queen appoints a Governor-General (on the advice of the elected  
Australian Government) to represent her. The Governor-General has wide powers, but by  
convention acts only on the advice of the ministers on virtually all matters.

#### 9.1.2. Nature of the Constitution

Like the United States, Australia has a written constitution. The Australian Constitution defines  
the responsibilities of the federal government, which include foreign relations, trade, defence  
and immigration. Governments of the States and territories are responsible for all matters not  
assigned to the Commonwealth, and they too adhere to the principles of responsible

government. In the States, the Queen is represented by a Governor for each State. Student Notes:

The High Court of Australia arbitrates on disputes between the Commonwealth and the states.  
Many of the court’s decisions have expanded the constitutional powers and responsibilities of  
the federal government.

**_Procedure of Amendment_**

The Australian Constitution can be amended only with the approval of the electorate through a  
national referendum in which all adults on the electoral roll must participate. A bill containing  
the amendment must first be passed by both houses of Parliament, or, in certain limited  
circumstances, by only one House of Parliament. Any constitutional change must be approved  
by a double majority—a national majority of electors as well as a majority of electors in a  
majority of the states (at least four of the six). Where any state or states are particularly  
affected by the subject of the referendum, a majority of voters in those states must also agree  
to the change. This is often referred to as the ‘triple majority’ rule.

The double majority provision makes alterations to the Constitution difficult. Since federation in  
1901, only eight out of 44 proposals to amend the Constitution have been approved. Voters are  
generally reluctant to support what they perceive as increases in the power of the federal  
government. States and territories may also hold referendums.

#### 9.1.3. Parliament

The government is formed in the House of Representatives by the party able to command a  
majority in that chamber.

Minority parties often hold the balance of power in the Senate, which serves as a chamber of  
review for the decisions of the government. Senators are elected for six-year terms, and in an  
ordinary general election only half the senators face the voters.

In the Australian Parliament, questions can be asked without notice, and there is a strict  
alternation between Government and Opposition questions to ministers during the Question  
Time. The Opposition uses its questions to pursue the government. Government members give  
ministers a chance to put government policies and actions in a favourable light, or to pursue the  
Opposition.

Anything said in the Parliament can be reported fairly and accurately without fear of a suit for  
defamation. The rough-and-tumble of Parliamentary Question Time and debates is broadcast  
and widely reported. This has helped in establishing Australia’s reputation for robust public  
debate, and serves as an informal check on the executive power.

#### 9.1.4. Nature of Elections

A national general election must be held within three years of the first meeting of a new federal  
Parliament. The average life of Parliaments is about two-and-a-half years. In practice, general  
elections are held when the Governor-General agrees to a request from the Prime Minister,  
who selects the date of the election.

The governing party has changed almost every five years on an average, since federation in

1901.  The Liberal Party led a coalition with the longest hold on government—23 years—from  
    1949 to 1972. Prior to World War II, several governments lasted less than a year, but since 1945  
    there have been only seven changes in the government.

#### 9.1.5. Voting

For all citizens over the age of 18 it is compulsory to vote in the election of both federal and  
state governments, and failure to do so may result in fine or prosecution.

#### 9 .1.6. Relations Between Levels of Government Student Notes:^

State parliaments are subject to the national Constitution as well as their state constitutions. A  
federal law overrides any state law not consistent with it.

In practice, the two levels of government cooperate in many areas where states and territories  
are formally responsible, such as education, transport, health and law enforcement. Income tax  
is levied federally, and debate between the levels of governments about access to revenue and  
duplication of expenditure functions is a perennial feature of Australian politics. Local  
government bodies are created by legislation at the state and territory level.

The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) is a forum to initiate, develop and implement  
national policy reforms requiring cooperative action between the three levels of government:  
national, state or territory, and local. Its objectives include dealing with major issues by  
cooperating on structural reform of government and on reforms to achieve an integrated,  
efficient national economy and a single national market.

-   COAG comprises the Prime minister, State Premiers, Chief Ministers of the territories, and  
    the President of the Australian Local Government Association.

In addition, Ministerial Councils (comprising national, state and territory ministers, and, where  
relevant, representatives of local government and of the governments of New Zealand and  
Papua New Guinea) meet regularly to develop and implement inter-governmental action in  
specific policy areas.

## 10\. Constitution of Switzerland

-   The Spirit of Republicanism is a prominent theme of the Swiss Constitution.
-   Another important feature of the Constitution is its federal features.
-   Switzerland is known for its direct democracy.
-   It is hailed as a Dynamic Constitution (features like protection of individual, welfare state et  
    al)

**_Comparison scheme w.r.t Indian Constitution_**

```

Institutions for Direct Democracy:

1.  **Referendum** : It means referring bills for ratification to the people. It is not similar to  
    plebiscite. Plebiscite means taking opinion of the people on any issue.
2.  **Initiative** : It is a bill initiated by the people and people conveying it to the assembly.
3.  **Recall** : It means calling the representative back at any point of time, if voters are not  
    satisfied by his work.

## 11\. Features-Wise Constitutional Comparison Scheme

### 11.1. The Preamble

The Preamble is a brief introductory statement that sets out the guiding purpose and principles  
of the document.

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

The language and the structural format of the Preamble of India have been derived from the Student Notes:  
United States of America.

### 11.2. Written Constitution

The concept of a written constitution has been taken from USA, which was the first written  
constitution in the world. This allows ease of access and revision, as and when required, and  
also provides immunity to laws form any arbitrary interference by the government at its free  
will.

### 11.3. Nominal Head

```
In Britain In India
The Queen is the Head of the
State. As a Constitutional Monarch,
she does not rule the country, but

-   Head of the state and the first citizen of India.
-   S/He is also the “formal head” of all the three  
    branches of Indian Democracy - Legislature,  
    Executive and Judiciary.
-   He is also the Supreme Commander of the Indian  
    Armed Forces

### 11.4. Cabinet System

Both in India and England:

-   The Cabinet is the collective decision-making body of the government consisting of the  
    Prime Minister and his Council of Ministers.
-   The PM chooses the Cabinet of Ministers, appointed by the head of the state (President in  
    India and Sovereign in England.)

The Cabinet Ministers are at the disposal of PM and can be dismissed at any time on advice of  
the PM, by the Head of the State.

### 11 .5. Bicameral System of Parliament

A bicameral Parliament or bicameral legislature is a legislature, which consists of two chambers  
or houses

-   **In England:** There is the House of Commons and House of Lords.
-   **In India:** There is Lok Sabha (the House of people) and Rajya Sabha (Council of States).

### 11 .8. Judiciary Adaptations

#### 11 .8.1. Concept of Supreme Court

It was adapted from the United States of America. US was the first country to introduce the  
highest court of justice, called the Supreme Court.

As we know, it is an essential requirement for a federal form of government.

#### 11 .8.2. Laws on Which Supreme Court Function

#### 11 .8.3. Independence of Judiciary and Judicial Review

-   Independence of the judiciary is the principle that the judiciary should be politically  
    shielded from the legislative and the executive power. That is, courts should not be  
    subjected to reprehensible influence from other branches of the government, or from  
    personal or adherent interests.
-   Judicial review is the doctrine under which legislative and executive actions are subject to  
    review (and possible invalidation) by the judiciary.  
    Specific courts with judicial review power must annul the acts of the state when it finds  
    them incompatible with a higher authority such as the constitution.

Both of these principles are adopted from the constitution of USA. Student Notes:

They are very important to keep a check on the other two branches of the government.

#### 11 .8.4. Method of Removal of Supreme/High Court Judges

This has been adopted from the Constitution of United States.

```
US Constitution Indian Constitution
It varies from state to state where
sometimes recommendation of enquiry
committee is enough, while in some
majority support by more than two-third
members of both houses is required for
impeachment of a judge.
```

```
Impeachment requires an order of the President
passed after an address in each House of
Parliament, supported by a majority of the total
membership of that House of not less than two-
thirds of members present and voting, and
presented to the President in the same Session
for such removal on the ground of proved
misbehavior or incapacity.
```

### 11 .9. Fundamental Rights

The purpose of Fundamental Rights is to act as limitations, not only upon the powers of the  
Executive, but also upon the power of the Legislature.

```
In Other Countries In India
The concept of fundamental comes
from USA.
```

```
Fundamental rights in the Constitution of India
constitute the longest description in the world.
```

```
The right to freedom of: speech,
assembly and religion have been
adopted from USSR
```

```
They include:
▪ Right to Equality (14-18)
▪ Right to Freedom (19)
▪ Right against Exploitation (23-24)
▪ Right to Freedom of Religion (25-28)
▪ Cultural and Educational Rights (29-30)
▪ Right to Constitutional remedies (32-35)
Right to freedom and equality before
law are an adoption from the French
rights
```

#### 11 .9.1. Suspension of Fundamental Rights During Emergency

This concept of suspension of rights during emergency has been adopted from the Weimar  
constitution of Germany.

This is very important as it vests the supreme power in the head of the state- the President.

-   During emergency only 3 rights of the citizens stand valid-Right to Equality, Right to  
    Freedom (in certain cases) and the Right to Life.

### 11 .10. Fundamental Duties

The fundamental duties of India seem to be an adoption from the Constitutions of Japan,  
Yugoslavia, Republic of China as well as the Constitution of Soviet Union (USSR).

Indeed, Japan is the only democratic country to have legally enforceable Fundamental duties.

These have been incorporated in the Indian Constitution to remind every citizen that they  
should not only be conscious of their rights, but also of their duties.

### 11 .11. Scheme of Federation Student Notes:^

This refers to the Distribution of powers between the centre and the states.

It is very significant in the case of a diverse country like India, to handle the local issues  
effectively.

This has been done in case of both legislative and administrative powers.

**_Scheme of federation with a strong Centre_**

Both the Centre & the states are expected to be co-operative& coordinating institutions, having  
independence & ought to exercise their respective powers with mutual-adjustment, respect,  
understanding & accommodation.

Prevention as well as amelioration of conflicts is necessary. Thus, the Indian-federation was  
devised with a strong-centre.

**_Comparison of Indian Federalism with American Federalism_**

**_Indian Constitution_**

1.  Indian federation is not the result of an agreement between States.
2.  There is concept of single citizenship for both the States and Union.
3.  Each State sends MPs to the Parliament depending upon the population of the State.
4.  There is no principle of equality between the states.
5.  There are three Lists- Union List-(First List); State List (Second List); and Concurrent List –  
    (Third List). The Parliament can legislate only the subjects of the State List and Concurrent  
    List. The States are not sovereign. The Union can encroach upon State’s Lists.
6.  No State can secede from Territory of India.
7.  The Parliament, i.e. Center has residuary powers.
8.  There is only one Constitution for Union and States.
9.  India achieved uniformity in basic civil and criminal laws, except personal laws in some  
    matters.
10.  The Indian Union is an indestructible Union of destructible States. The area, identity of a  
    state can be changed by Parliament. The States are destructible. But the Union cannot be  
    changed. The Union is indestructible.
11.  The Central Government has the power to form a new State, to increase the area of any  
    State, to diminish the area of any State; to alter the boundaries of any State; to alter the  
    name of any State; and to form a new State by separation of territory from any State or by  
    uniting two or more States or parts of States or by uniting any territory to be a part of any  
    State(Article 3).
12.  The word “Federal” is not at all used in our Constitution. The framers described simply  
    “Union”.
13.  The Supreme Court has been given very wide powers, including appellate (Civil and  
    criminal) jurisdiction.
14.  No referendum is necessary. For the amendment of the Constitution, the people need not  
    give their consent. It is sufficient to get the majority of MPs, and in certain cases, the  
    majority of the State legislatures.

**_American Constitution_**

1.  American Federation is the result of an agreement between States.
2.  There are dual citizenships- one Federal Citizenship and another State Citizenship.
3.  Each State sends equal number of representatives to the Senate.
4.  There is principle of equality between the States, irrespective of its population, extent etc.
5.  There is a clear division of legislative powers between the Federal Govt. and the Units. The  
    Union as well as each Unit is sovereign in its sphere. The Union and the units are sovereign

in their respective legislative fields. One cannot strictly trench upon the other’s area of Student Notes:
power. Each is confined to its own sphere.
```

6.  The State, if wants, can theoretically separate itself from the Federal, the relation being  
    based only an ‘Agreement ’.Hence, it is said that the American Union is a destructible Union  
    of indestructible States.
7.  The States have residuary powers.
8.  There are two Constitutions.
9.  There are different civil and criminal laws, differing from State to State.
10.  The word “Federal” is used in the Constitution very often.
11.  The Supreme Court of America has not been given appellate jurisdiction of the same kind  
    as the Supreme Court in India.
12.  For the amendment of Federal Constitution, a referendum must be conducted. Amendment  
    to the Constitution can be made only with the consent of the people.

### 11 .12. Freedom of Trade and Commerce

```
Australia India
There is a free trade clause under Section
92 of the Australian Constitution, which
provides that “on the imposition of uniform
duties of customs, trade, commerce and
intercourse among the States whether by
means of internal carriage or ocean
navigation shall be absolutely free.
```

```
Article 301 containing the free trade clause in
Indian constitution has been taken almost
verbatim from section 92 of the Australian
constitution
```

```
The court considered that legislature should be
given more powers than judiciary and all trade
and commerce activities were subjected to
reasonable restrictions, imposed by the State as
mentioned in the constitution
```

**_Advantages of this adoption_**

Free movement and exchange of goods throughout the territory of the country is essential for  
the economic unity of the nation

Therefore, in all federations, an attempt is made through constitutional provisions to prevent  
local barriers to economic activity, to remove the impediments in the way of inter-state trade  
and commerce and thus to make the country as one in economic resources.

Thus, the base of freedom of trade and commerce was adopted from Australian Constitution  
with amendments.

### 11 .13. Directive Principles of State Policy

These are principles laid down to create social and economic conditions under which citizens  
can live a good life.

In India, the Directive Principles of State policy have been adopted verbatim from the  
Constitution of Ireland. The DPSP of Ireland were in turn adopted from Spain.

### 11 .14. Election of Members by the President

The upper house in India consists of 250 members from which 12 are nominated by the  
Nominal head-the President of the country for their exemplary work in their respective fields.

This saves these members from the turmoil of election

This system has been adopted from the constitution of Ireland.

**_1\. The Indian constitution wonderfully adopts the via media between the American_**  
**_system of Judicial Supremacy and the British principle of parliamentary supremacy._**  
**_Explain._**

**_Approach:_**

```
The statement has been taken from D.D. Basu’s discussion on the salient features of the
Indian constitution. The question is static and conceptual in nature. The answer should
reflect awareness and understanding of Parliamentary supremacy in Britain, Judicial
supremacy in USA and a balanced compromise or synthesis of Parliamentary
sovereignty and judicial supremacy in the case of India.
```

**_Answer:_**

```
Under the British constitution courts cannot nullify any act of Parliament on any
ground whatsoever.
```

-   In the United States, on the other hand the Supreme Court has come to acquire  
    apposition wherein it can invalidate a law not only on the ground that it  
    transgresses the scope of legislative power vested in the constitution but also on  
    the basis of prohibitions contained in the bill of rights as well as on the basis of  
    general principles such as due process as defined and interpreted by the court  
    itself.
-   As opposed to these extremes the Indian constitution endows the judiciary with  
    the power of declaring a law as unconstitutional if it is beyond the competence of  
    the legislature according to the distribution of powers provided by the constitution,  
    or if it is in contravention of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution.  
    At the same it also deprives the judiciary of any power of ‘judicial review’ as far as  
    the wisdom of legislative policy is concerned.
-   Simply put, The Supreme Court in India can declare the parliamentary laws as  
    unconstitutional through its power of judicial review and the Parliament on its part  
    can amend major portion of the constitution through its constituent power.
-   Additionally, the scope of power of judicial review in India is narrower than in the  
    case of the Supreme Court in the US ostensibly because the American constitution

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

provides for ‘due process of law’ as opposed to the concept of ‘procedure Student Notes:

-   However, it has to be born in mind the Judiciary in India has broadened the ambit

    **_2\. The Upper Chamber of Parliaments across the world are generally considered less  
    powerful vis-à-vis their Lower Chamber. However, they are also vested with certain  
    functions and powers, which enables them to play a decisive role. Critically analyse  
    with special emphasis on India._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Power and status of UC – how it is inferior in powers in legislative, impeachment  
    processes etc.
-   Special power – India (article 249 and 312), control over executive etc.
-   Conclude by saying that upper chamber is an important institution but has been  
    given less power w.r.t. lower house.

**_Answer:_**

```
Upper Chamber (UC) is one of the two chambers of a bicameral legislature. In a unitary
system, UC is seen as an advisory chamber while in federal systems, it has been granted
nearly equal powers with the lower chamber. Rajya Sabha (RS) of India enjoys co-equal
status in all aspects except in certain financial matters.
Reasons for inferior position of UC are multiple. In fact, there were heated debated in
the constitutional assembly of almost every country for the need of UC. Thomas
Jefferson also opposed the idea of two chambers. It is indirectly elected body,
undemocratic and subversive of the will of the people expressed through the elected
Lower Chamber (LC). One argued that “if a Second Chamber dissents from the first it is
mischievous; if it agrees, it’s superfluous”. Following are certain powers and status
enjoyed by UC across the world:
```

-   In some countries only limited legislative matters, such as constitutional  
    amendments, require its approval. In UK, the House of Lords, UC, can no longer  
    prevent the passage of most bills. In countries where it _can_ veto legislation (like the  
    Netherlands), it may not be able to amend the proposals.
-   LC is directly elected by the people and thus given power for matters related to  
    finance. RS can delay a money bill for two weeks only.
-   In parliamentary system, UC cannot vote a motion of no-confidence against the  
    government. This is true for India also.
-   England has an evolutionary political system where power has gradually shifted  
    from crown to the House of Lords, UC to the House of Commons. Now, UC acts as a  
    revising chamber more or less.  
    However, federal systems have granted some special powers to the UC. USA has one of  
    the strongest UC in the world. States surrendered their power to the centre and thus,  
    UC enjoys some special powers which are not with the LC. India also supported strong  
    federation initially. But still, RS enjoys certain special power. Some of them are as  
    follows:
-   UC of countries like USA may give advice and consent to some executive decisions  
    (e.g. appointments of judges, international treaties or ambassadors).

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   UC may have the sole power to try impeachments against officials of the executive. Student Notes:^  
    In USA, it is the Senate that finally adjudicates and convict on this issue. RS of India  
    has extra power to remove vice-president of India.
-   Prior to 2009, UC of UK served as the court of last resort.
-   Article 249 gives power to RS to pass a resolution to empower parliament to enact  
    law on the state subject. Similarly RS can pass a resolution to create a new All-India-  
    service (AIS) under article 312
-   RS can extend the life of a Proclamation issued under article 352, 356, and 360 in  
    the events of the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.  
    Overall, reasons for the UC have always remained a subject of debate. Some call it  
    undemocratic due to its structure (indirect election of members) while others favour it  
    for its revising and other powers. India’s RS enjoys equal powers except in money  
    legislations.  
    **_3\. Whereas the legislature is empowered to regulate the ratification of international  
    treaties in the United States, in India it is mostly the domain of the executive. Examine  
    the rationale and benefits of these two approaches with examples._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Briefly explain the treaty making powers in India and USA and contrast it with  
    democracies where Legislature also have a role to play in treaty making.
-   In the light of recommendations made by the National Commission to Review the  
    Working of the Constitution and various SC rulings, critically analyze the issues  
    involved.

**_Answer:_**

```
Entering into treaties and agreements with foreign powers is one of the attributes of
State sovereignty. No State can insulate itself from the rest of the world whether it be
in the matter of foreign relations, trade, environment, communications, ecology or
finance.
Treaty making in United States
```

-   The Constitution of USA provides that the president "shall have Power, by and with  
    the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the  
    Senators present concur".
-   The rationale in giving the Senate a share of the treaty power is to give the  
    president the **benefit of the Senate's advice and counsel, check presidential**  
    **power, and safeguard the sovereignty of the states by giving each state an equal**  
    **vote in the treaty making process.**
-   The Senate does not ratify treaties—the Senate approves or rejects a resolution of  
    ratification. If the resolution passes, then ratification takes place when the  
    instruments of ratification are formally exchanged between the United States and  
    the foreign power(s).
-   In addition to treaties, which may not enter into force and become binding on the  
    United States without the advice and consent of the Senate, there are other types  
    of international agreements concluded by the executive branch and not submitted  
    to the Senate. These are classified in the United States as executive agreements,  
    not as treaties, a distinction that has only domestic significance.
-   The US Constitution is silent about how treaties might be terminated.

Treaty making in India Student Notes:
```

-   Under the Indian Constitution, the power to enter into treaties figures in the **Union**  
    **List** that covers areas on which Parliament has the exclusive right to legislate  
    **(Article 246)** , while **Article 73** extends the executive power of the Centre to all  
    matters on which Parliament can legislate.
-   For implementing any treaty, Parliament under **Article 253** can legislate on any item  
    even under the State List.
-   But in the **absence of a specific provision stipulating the procedure for the**  
    **negotiation and ratification of treaties,** the exercise of this power has by and large  
    remained a preserve of the executive, which has tended to interpret Article 73 to  
    mean that its authority extends over the subjects included in the Union List.
-   On the contrary, the **judiciary has through several pronouncements emphasized**  
    **that the power to enter into a treaty is essentially political in nature** and therefore  
    called for the enactment of a **separate legislation to govern the conclusion of**  
    **treaties.**
-   The **National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution** has voiced a  
    similar view and recommended that **Parliament pass a law to regulate the treaty-**  
    **making power** of the government, but it stopped short of prescribing  
    parliamentary ratification.
-   Any process of ratification of international obligations by national parliaments will  
    necessarily be **protracted** in view of conflicting perceptions and interests and  
    various other factors such as the level of development of institutional mechanisms  
    relative to the maturity of democracy. Yet, the requirement of ratification by  
    Parliament will ensure that international agreements and treaties with far reaching  
    implications are subjected to **a closer legislative scrutiny and a wider political and**  
    **public discussion.**

```
The exercise of the power of treaty making cannot be absolute or unchartered in view
of the federal structure of legislative and executive powers. So Parliament should make
a law on the subject of treaty making and implement it through Parliamentary
legislation to streamline the procedures involved.
This has been recommended by both Venkatachalliah commission and Punchhi
commission. Punchhi commission also recommends that financial obligations and its
implications on state finances arising out of treaties and agreements should be a
permanent term of reference to the finance commission.
Treaties which affect the rights and obligations of citizens as well as those which
directly impinge on subjects in State List should be negotiated with greater involvement
of States and representatives in Parliament.

**_Answer:_** Student Notes:

-   The above statement rests on the theory of inalienable natural rights which can by  
    no means be denied to an individual in a free society. The guarantee of some of  
    those rights in the written constitution cannot render obsolete any right which was  
    available to the individual even before the constitution.
-   The category of fundamental rights under the Constitution of India is exhaustively  
    enumerated in Part 3 of the Constitution. So, the courts cannot impose any  
    limitation upon the legislature or executive on the basis of natural rights. Any  
    expansion of fundamental rights under the Indian Constitution rests on judicial  
    interpretation and the courts have done so by enlarging the scope of many articles  
    especially article 21.
-   But the above does not mean that there is no other justiciable right provided by  
    Indian Constitution outside part 3. Limitations upon the state are imposed by other  
    provisions of the Constitution and these limitations give rise to corresponding rights  
    to the individual.
-   For example, Article 265 says that “no tax shall be levied or collected except by  
    authority of law”. This gives a right to an individual not to be subjected to arbitrary  
    taxation by the executive. Similarly Article 300A provides that “No person shall be  
    deprived of his property save by authority of law”.
-   Though the rights of both the above mentioned classes are equally justiciable, the  
    difference between them lies in the way they can be enforced. The Constitutional  
    remedy by way of an application direct to the Supreme Court under Article 32 is  
    available only in case of fundamental rights mentioned in part 3 of the Constitution.
-   If the right follows from some other provisions of the constitution like Article 265 or  
    300A, the aggrieved person may have his relief by an ordinary suit or by an  
    application under Article 226 to the High Court. But an application under Article 32  
    shall not lie unless the invasion of non-fundamental right involves the violation of  
    some fundamental right as well.  
    **_5\. In comparison with the American constitutional arrangement, where there is strict  
    separation of executive and legislature, the Indian Constitution provides for a fused  
    structure. Do you think this system has worked for India?_**

**_Approach:_**

```
The answer should contain the following parts –
```

-   Explain briefly the arrangement in India vis-à-vis USA
-   The reasons for going with this arrangement
-   Explain what are the benefits of this system
-   Way forward – How to make this system more efficient and effective  
    **_Answer:_**
-   The American constitution envisages a strict separation of powers where the  
    executive and the legislature have no overlap. The President in USA, appoints his  
    own staff/council of ministers and does not have anything to do with the  
    legislature unlike India and is not responsible to the legislature like India. But in  
    Indian system, the executive comes from the party, which has the majority in the  
    Lok Sabha. Therefore meaning that the Council of ministers draws members from  
    the legislature thereby diluting the strict watertight compartments between the  
    executive and the legislature.
-   The reason why our founding fathers did not adopt a strict separation of legislature  
    and executive is because it could cause unnecessary conflict between the two  
    organs of the government, which our infant democracy could ill-afford.

    with the American system. If the President belongs to a party, which doesn’t holds  
    majority in the Congress than there is a possibility of a deadlock if the President  
    and the Congress don’t agree on that issue. But in Indian system the executive  
    comes from the party, which has the majority in Lok Sabha. Hence, for important  
    bills like money bills there is no scope for deadlock.
-   Secondly, a majority in the Lok Sabha doesn’t give a free hand to the executive. The  
    Rajya Sabha also functions as another check on the power of the executive. Hence,  
    in our system there is cooperation between legislature and the executive as well as  
    checks and balances on both the organs.
-   Going forward, we must strengthen our parliamentary processes. Most bills must  
    be passed through debates and discussion rather than the ruling party forcing them  
    through the Parliament.
-   The executive should be held accountable for its actions through various motions,  
    question hour etc. The spirit of cooperation between the two organs must be  
    recognized and embraced.

## 1\. Introduction Student Notes:^

### 1.1. Definition

A Constitution is a document of people’s faith and aspirations possessing a special legal sanctity.  
A Constitution is the fundamental law of a country. It is the rulebook of a nation, which  
regulates the society and its laws.

There are various forms of government prevalent across the world. It is the philosophy  
embodied in a nation’s constitution which determines the kind of government present there.

### 1.2. Functions of the Constitution

A Constitution, whether it is written or unwritten, always has several functions, some of which  
are as follows:

a) **Expression of Ideology:** It reflects the ideology and philosophy of a nation state.  
b) **Expression of Basic Law:** A Constitution presents basic laws, which can usually be modified  
or replaced through a process of amendment. Generally, there are special laws too, which  
focus upon the rights of the citizens; for instance, rights concerning freedom of speech,  
religion, assembly, press etc.  
c) **Organizational framework:** It provides an organizational framework for the government. It  
defines the functions of legislature, executive and judiciary, their inter-relationship,  
restrictions on their authority etc.  
d) **Levels of Government:** A Constitution generally explains the levels of different organs of  
the Government. Whether it is federal, confederation or unitary, is usually described by the  
Constitution. It may also delineate the powers of national and provincial governments.  
e) **Provisions for amendment:** As it would not be possible to foretell all possibilities in future  
with great degree of accuracy, there must be sufficient provisions for amendment of the  
Constitution. So, it should contain a set of directions for its own modifications. Inherent  
capacity to change according to changing times and needs help any system to survive and  
improve.

**_Example:_**

The Soviet Constitution was mostly an expression of ideology and was less an expression of  
organizational set up. The American Constitution is more an expression of governmental  
organization and a guideline for the power relationship of the regime than an expression of the  
philosophy of the government of the day.

### 1.3. Understanding the Constitutionalism

The unrestrained/unchecked state power may be exercised arbitrarily by the rulers. A  
Constitution is created as a defence mechanism over and above the state power. This  
arrangement, which forces the rulers to stay within the jurisdiction by means of a (generally)  
written or even unwritten Constitution, is called Constitutionalism.

Constitutionalism implies that the exercise of political power shall be bound by limitations,  
checks, controls and rules. The concept of Constitutionalism incorporates the principles of  
‘limited government’ and ‘rule of law’, as against arbitrary and authoritarian discharge of  
power.

A **limited government** is a political system in which legalized governmental power is restricted by  
law, usually the constitution. Countries with limited governments have laws about what  
government can and can’t do. Any country that has a democratic governmental system is an example  
of one that is a limited government. Many countries throughout the world have a limited government,  
and a few examples are United States, England, Australia, Japan etc. In India, it is constitutionally-

#### limited government, bound to specific principles and actions by the constitution.

According to K C Wheare and W G Andrews, Constitutionalism implies: Student Notes:

-   Division of powers
-   Acceptance of plurality of interests in society
-   No authoritative or dictatorial leadership
-   Minimum constraints on individual freedom

According to Carl J Friedrich, the division of powers is the most important basis of  
Constitutionalism. Constitutionalism may exist in a monarchy or republic, aristocracy or  
democracy, if there is division of power.

#### 1.3.1. Constitutionalism in India

Constitutionalism in India is an amalgamation of the following underlying principles:

-   Written Constitution,
-   Responsible Government,
-   Parliamentary Democracy,
-   Rule of Law,
-   Fundamental Rights,
-   Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances,
-   Flexibility of Constitution and its Basic Structure,
-   A Federal Form of Government,
-   Independent Judiciary and Judicial Review etc.

The concept of Constitutionalism has been recognised by the Supreme Court in **Rameshwar  
Prasad v. Union of India.** The Court stated, “The constitutionalism or constitutional system of  
Government abhors absolutism-it is premised on the Rule of Law in which subjective  
satisfaction is substituted by objectivity provided by the provisions of the Constitution itself.”

In **IR Coehlo v. State of Tamil Nadu** , the Court held that Constitutionalism is a legal principle  
that requires control over the exercise of governmental power to ensure that the democratic  
principles on which the government is formed shall not be destroyed.

## 2\. Historical Underpinnings

### 2.1. Role of Developments under the British rule

These events can be summarized under two heads:

-   Under the British East India Company (1773 – 1858)
-   Under the British Crown (1858 – 1947)

### 2.2. Analysis

We can study the historical developments from two perspectives:

-   General features, and

#### • Features related in some form with current scheme of the Constitution (marked with ‘\*‘ )

#### 2.2.1. Developments under the Company Rule (1773-1858)

The British government passed many laws and acts in India which elicited different reactions  
from different parts of the Indian society and played a pivotal role in the modeling of either the  
Indian polity or the Society. Some of the most important and consequential acts are listed  
below:

```

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

**1\. Regulating Act of 1773** Student Notes:  
\- It designated the Governor of Bengal as Governor General of Bengal. It created an  
executive council of four members to assist him. Lord Warren Hastings became the first  
Governor General of Bengal.  
\- The governors of Bombay and Madras were made subordinate to the Governor-General  
of Bengal. This started a tendency towards ‘centralization’ of power, which continued  
up till the Charter Act, 1833.\*  
\- A Supreme Court was established as the Apex Court at Calcutta in 1774, comprising one  
Chief Justice and three other judges_.  
\- It strengthened the control of British government over the Company by requiring the  
Court of Directors (governing body of the Company) to report on its revenue, civil and  
military affairs in India. It prohibited company officials from engaging in private trade  
and from accepting gifts from Indians.  
\- It has constitutional importance as it laid the principles of central administration in  
India._  
**2\. Pitt’s India Act of 1784**  
\- Commercial and political functions of the company were separated. The Court of  
Directors managed the commercial activities while the Board of Control managed  
political affairs.  
\- The Board of Control in England was mandated to supervise the East India Company's  
affairs. It consisted of six members, which included one Secretary of State from the  
British cabinet, as well as the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  
\- The Act reduced the number of members of the Executive Council to three, of whom  
the Commander-in-Chief was to be one. It also modified the Councils of Madras and  
Bombay on the pattern of that of Bengal.  
\- It empowered the Board of Control to supervise and direct all operations of civil and  
military revenues of the British possessions. Thus, it paved the way for evolution of dual  
government.  
\- The Company’s territories were for the first time called ‘British possession in India’.  
**Analysis of the Act**  
As pointed above (through formation of Board of Control), it introduced the Dual System of  
government: by the Company and by a Parliamentary Board, which lasted till 1858.  
\- The Board of Control had no independent executive power.  
\- It had no patronage. Its powers were veiled.  
\- It had access to all the Company's papers and its approval was necessary for all  
dispatches that were not purely commercial. Also, in case of emergency the Board  
could send its own draft to the Secret Committee of the Directors to be signed and sent  
out in its name.  
Thus, the Act placed the civil and military government of the Company in due subordination  
to the Government in England.  
**3\. Charter Act, 1813**  
\- This act did not bring about any significant changes in the administration of India.  
\- Continental System introduced by Napoleon led to restriction on British’s European  
trade. It forced British companies and merchants to diversify their trade away from  
Europe. Hence, they wanted end of East India Company’s monopoly over Indian trade.  
In this context, Charter Act ended Company’s monopoly in trade with India.  
\- However, trade in tea and trade with China remained exclusively with Company.  
\- It had a provision that Company should invest Rs. 1 Lakh every year on the education of  
Indians. However, this was not implemented in effect.  
\- It empowered local governments to impose taxes and punish for their non-payment  
subject to the jurisdiction of Supreme Court.

**4\. Charter Act, 1833** Student Notes:  
\- Also known as **‘Saint Helena Act’** , it brought about the final step of ‘centralization’, as  
mentioned earlier.  
o It made the Governor-General of Bengal as the Governor-General of India and  
vested in him all the military and civil powers. Lord William Bentinck was the first  
Governor-General of India.  
o All law-making powers were conferred on the Governor-General and his Council.  
o Thus, the Act created for the first time, a government of India having authority over  
the entire territorial area possessed by the British in India.\*  
\- Laws under previous acts were called as **_‘Regulations’_** , while those under Charter Act,  
1833 were called as **_‘Acts’_**.  
\- The Act ended the East India Company’s monopoly over trade with India. It became a  
purely administrative body. Trade with India was open to all British subjects.  
\- It attempted to codify all the Indian Laws. In this regard, it directed the government to  
set up an Indian Law Commission. Hence, India’s first law commission was set up with  
Lord Macaulay as its Chairman.  
\- It **_tried_** to bring about a system of open competition for selection of Civil Servants. \*  
o The above provision was however **_negated_** by opposition of the Court of Directors  
of Company.  
**5\. Charter Act, 1853**  
It’s considered as a significant constitutional landmark:  
\- For the first time, legislative and executive functions (of the Governor General’s  
Council) were clearly demarcated.  
o It provided for addition of six new members under a body called ‘Indian Legislative  
Council’ or ‘Central Legislative Council’. Four out of six members were appointed by  
the provisional governments of Madras, Bombay, Bengal and Agra.  
o Thus, it marked the beginning of Parliamentary system in India.  
\- It introduced an open competition system for selection and recruitment of civil  
servants.\*  
o It implied that the ‘covenanted’ civil services were now open for Indians too.  
o Macaulay Committee was set up to recommend for enforcing the same in 1854.  
\- It introduced for the first time, local (provincial) representation to Indian Legislative  
Council. Four members were appointed by the local governments of Madras, Bombay,  
Bengal and Agra.  
\- It extended Company’s rule and allowed it to retain the possession of Indian territories  
on trust for British Crown. But, it did not specify any particular period, unlike previous  
Charters. This was an indication that the Company’s rule could be terminated at any  
time the Parliament liked.

#### 2.2.2. Developments under the British Crown’s Rule

**1\. Government of India Act, 1858**

```
The Act is also known as the ‘Act for the Good Government of India’. After the 1857 revolt,
the rule of the company was ended and transferred the powers of government, territories
and revenues to the British crown.
The Act was largely confined to improvement of the administrative machinery. It did not
alter significantly the system of government that prevailed in India.
Few other important features were:
```

-   It ended the system of double government by abolishing the Board of Control and  
    Court of Directors.
-   It established a new office of Secretary of State for complete authority and control over  
    Indian administration.

```
o The Secretary of State would be a member of the British Cabinet and was Student Notes:
responsible to the British Parliament.
o He was assisted by a 15-member Council in India.
▪ The Council was an advisory body.
▪ The Secretary of State was its chairperson.
o Thus, it established control of British Parliament over Indian affairs. Administration
of the country was now highly centralized.
```

**2\. Indian Councils Acts** : They were total 3 in number: 1861, 1892 and 1909.  
\- **Act of 1861**  
o Indians were, for the first time, made a part of the law making process.  
▪ The Viceroy could now nominate a few Indians as non-official members.  
o It initiated the process of decentralization by restoring powers to Bombay and  
Madras Presidency.\*  
o It provided for establishment of new legislative councils for Bengal, North-Western  
Frontier Province (NWFP) and Punjab, which were established in 1862, 1866 and  
1897 respectively.  
o It also gave recognition to the **‘portfolio’ system** , introduced by Lord Canning in  
1859.\*  
o It empowered the Viceroy to issue ordinances.\*  
\- **Act of 1892**  
o It increased the number of non-official members in the Central and provincial  
legislative councils, but maintained official majority in them.  
o The Act made a limited and indirect provision for the use of election in filling up  
some of the non-official seats in both, Central, as well as, Provincial Legislative  
Councils_. Thus, the element of election was introduced for the first time. However,  
the word ‘nomination’ was used instead of ‘elections’.  
o It increased the functions of legislative councils:  
▪ Power of discussing budget was granted.  
▪ Questions could now be addressed to the Executive.  
\- **Act of 1909 (Morley-Minto Reforms)**  
o It increased the number of seats of legislative councils, both at central and  
provincial levels. The number of members of the Central legislative council was  
increased from 16 to 60.  
o It retained official majority in Central Legislative Council but allowed the provincial  
legislative councils to have non-official majority.  
o Members of legislative councils were given wider deliberative powers. They could  
now ask supplementary questions, move resolutions on budget et al._  
o It provided for a provision for Indians to participate in executive councils. Satyendra  
Prasad Sinha became the first Indian to become listed on the Viceroy’s Executive  
Council. He was appointed as the law member of the British ministry.  
o It introduced the system of communal representation for Muslims by accepting the  
concept of ‘separate electorate’. Under this, the Muslim members were to be  
elected only by the Muslim voters. Thus, the Act ‘legalized communalism’ and Lord  
Minto came to be known as **Father of Communal Electorate**.  
**3\. The Government of India Act, 1919 (Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms)**

```
In 1917, the British Government declared, for the first time, that its objective was the
gradual introduction of responsible government in India (Secretary of state Montagu’s
declaration). The Government of India Act, of 1919 was thus enacted, though not
completely in line with the above stand.

```
Following are its important features: Student Notes:
```

-   Relaxation of central control over the provinces by demarcating the central and  
    provincial subjects. Respective legislatures at centre and provinces were authorized to  
    make laws on their respective subjects.\*  
    o However, the basic government structure was largely centralized and unitary.\*
-   Dyarchy was introduced at the level of provinces.  
    o Dyarchy implies division of governance subjects into two parts.  
    o These two parts were namely: transferred subjects(to be administered by the  
    Governor with the aid of ministers) and reserved subjects (to be administered by  
    the Governor and his Executive Council without being responsible to the  
    legislature)
-   Bicameralism was introduced for the first time. It was introduced at the Centre.
-   Direct elections were introduced for the first time.\*  
    o Franchise was granted to some limited people on foundation of property, tax and  
    education.
-   Separation of central budget from provincial budget.\*
-   It provided for the establishment of a Public Service Commission. Hence, a Central  
    Public Service Commission was set up in 1926 (on recommendation of Lee Commission,  
    1923 - 24).\*
-   It extended the principle of communal representation by providing separate electorates  
    for Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians and Europeans.
-   It provided for the appointment of a statutory commission to inquire into and report on  
    its working after ten years of its coming into force.  
    **4\. Government of India Act, 1935**  
    In line with the 1919 Act, the British Government announced the appointment of a seven-  
    member statutory commission under the chairmanship of Sir John Simon to report on the  
    condition of India under its new Constitution. All members of the commission were British  
    and, hence, all parties boycotted the commission. To consider the proposals of commission,  
    the British Government convened three round table conferences of the representatives of  
    the British Government, British India and Indian princely states. On the basis of these  
    discussions, a ‘White Paper on Constitutional Reforms’ was prepared and submitted for  
    consideration of a British Parliamentary Committee. Recommendations of this committee  
    were incorporated (with certain changes) in Government of India Act of 1935. This Act has a  
    singularly important role to play in framing of the Constitution in its current form, purely  
    owing to the fact that several features of this Act have been incorporated, one way or the  
    other, by our Constitution makers. Also, the Act endeavoured to give a written Constitution  
    to the country. Further, after centuries, Indians got an opportunity to assume responsibility  
    of running the administration of their country.  
    Some of its prominent features were:
-   It provided for the establishment of an All-India Federation consisting of provinces and  
    princely states as units. The Act divided the powers between the Centre and units in  
    terms of three lists - Federal List, Provincial List and Concurrent List. Residuary powers  
    were given to the Viceroy. However, the federation never came into being as princely  
    states did not join it.
-   It abolished dyarchy introduced in the provinces by the GOI Act, 1919 and introduced  
    ‘provincial autonomy’ in its place. The provinces were allowed to act as autonomous  
    units of administration in their defined spheres. Moreover, the Act introduced  
    responsible governments in provinces, that is, the Governor was required to act with  
    the advice of ministers responsible to the provincial legislature. This came into effect in  
    1937 and was discontinued in 1939.

-   It provided for adoption of dyarchy at the Centre. Consequently, federal subjects were Student Notes:^  
    divided into reserved subjects and transferred subjects. However, this provision of the  
    Act did not come into operation at all.
-   Bicameralism was introduced in six out of eleven provinces. Thus, the legislatures of  
    U.P., Bihar, Assam, Bengal, Madras and Bombay came to consist of two houses - the  
    Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, whereas other provinces consisted of  
    one House i.e. Legislative Assembly. The membership criteria of these houses varied  
    from province to province. At the centre, the federal legislature consisted of two  
    houses, the Council of States and Federal Assembly consisting of 260 and 375 members  
    respectively. The Council of States (Upper House) was a permanent body, one-third of  
    whose members were to retire every three years.
-   A Federal Court was established at the Centre.

```
Besides the above, it also contained the following provisions:
```

-   Formation of the provinces of Sindh and Orissa.
-   It further extended the principle of communal representation by providing separate  
    electorates for depressed classes (scheduled castes), women, and labour (workers).
-   Separation of Burma and Aden from India.
-   The Indian Council was abolished and a few advisers, varying from 3 to 6, were  
    appointed to advise the Secretary of States in his policy formulation towards India.
-   The Secretary was normally not expected to interfere in the Indian affairs, which were  
    to be carried out by Governors.
-   With respect to the changes brought in the Federal Government, the Viceroy remained  
    its head. He exercised a wide range of powers concerning administration, legislation  
    and finance.
-   The Act created provisions for reserved subjects, to be looked after by the Viceroy  
    through Executive Councilors. Similarly, the transferred subjects were also to be under  
    the Viceroy, aided by Indian ministers, not more than 10 in number, selected from the  
    legislature.
-   In case of the provincial government, the Governor carried on the administration with  
    the help of a council of ministers selected by him from among the members of the  
    provincial legislature. The composition of the provincial legislature also varied from one  
    province to the other.
-   It provided for the establishment of a Reserve Bank of India to control the currency and  
    credit of the country.
-   It extended the franchise and about 10 per cent of the total population got the voting  
    right.  
    **Critical Analysis of the Act**

```
It is said that the act was nothing but ‘sugar-coated quinine’:
```

-   The proposed scheme for establishing a Federation proved to be a non-starter, as the  
    princely states did not join it.
-   Though it introduced Dyarchy in the Centre and autonomy in Provinces, but the powers  
    of the elected or nominated members were limited. The Act had retained control of the  
    Central Government over the Provinces in a certain sphere – by requiring the Governor  
    to act ‘in his discretion’ or in the exercise of his ‘individual judgment’ in certain matters.  
    In such matters the Governor was to act without ministerial advice and under the  
    control and directions of the Viceroy, and, through him, of the Secretary of State.
-   The legislative powers of both the Central and Provincial Legislatures were subject to  
    various limitations and neither could be said to have possessed the features of a  
    sovereign Legislature. Consider, for instance, the following:

```

```

```
o Apart from the Viceroy’s power of veto, a Bill passed by the Central Legislature was Student Notes:
also subject to veto by the Crown.
o The Viceroy might prevent discussion in the Legislature and suspend the
proceedings in regard to any Bill if he was satisfied that it would affect the
discharge of his ‘special responsibilities’.
o Apart from the power to promulgate Ordinances during the recess of the
Legislature, the Viceroy had independent powers of legislation, concurrently with
those of the Legislature. Thus, he had the power to make temporary Ordinances as
well as permanent Acts at any time for the discharge of his special responsibilities.
o No bill or amendment could be introduced in the Legislature without the Viceroy’s
previous sanction, with respect to certain matters, e.g., if the Bill or amendment
sought to repeal or amend or was repugnant to any law of the British Parliament
extending to India or any Viceroy’s or Governor’s Act, or if it sought to affect
matters as respects which the Viceroy was required to act in his discretion.
```

There were similar restraints on the Provincial Legislature.

The Instruments of Instructions issued under the Act further required that Bills relating to a  
number of subjects, such as those derogating from the powers of a High Court or affecting the  
Permanent Settlement, when presented to the Viceroy or a Governor for his assent, were to be  
reserved for the consideration of the Crown or the Viceroy, as the case might be.

#### 2.2.3. Other Intermediate Developments

**1\. Communal Award**  
\- After the Second Round Table Conference, in August 1932, the British PM, Ramsay  
Macdonald gave his ‘Communal Award’. According to it, separate representation was to  
be provided to the forward castes, lower castes, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, Indian  
Christians, Anglo-Indians, Europeans and Dalits. The Dalits were assigned a number of  
seats to be filled by election from special constituencies in which voters belonging to  
the Dalit community only could vote.  
\- The award was opposed by Mahatma Gandhi, who fasted in protest against it. After  
lengthy negotiations, Gandhi reached an agreement - called the Poona Pact - with Dr.  
Ambedkar to have a single Hindu electorate, with Dalits having seats reserved within it.  
**2\. Cripps Mission**  
\- In March 1942, Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the British cabinet came with a draft  
declaration on the proposals of the British Government. These proposals were to be  
adopted at the end of the Second World War, provided the Congress and Muslim  
League could accept them.  
\- According to the proposals:  
o The Constitution of India was to be framed by a Constituent Assembly elected for  
the purpose by the Indian people.  
o The Constitution should provide India, a dominion status.  
o There should be one Indian Union comprising all the provinces and Indian states.  
o Any province (or Indian state) not accepting the Constitution would be free to  
retain its constitutional position existing at that time, and with such a non-acceding  
province, British Government could enter into separate constitutional  
arrangements.  
**3\. Cabinet Mission**

In March 1946, Lord Clement Atlee sent a Cabinet Mission to India consisting of three  
Cabinet Ministers, namely Lord Pethick Lawrence, Sir Stafford Cripps and Mr. A.V. Alexander.

The object of Cabinet Mission was to help India achieve its independence as early as  
possible, and to set up a Constitutional Assembly. According to the Cabinet Mission Plan,

there was to be a Union of India, comprising both British India and the States, having Student Notes:
jurisdiction over the subjects of foreign affairs, defence and communication. All residuary
powers were to be vested in the provinces and the states.
```

The Union was to have an executive and a legislature consisting of representatives of the  
provinces and the states. The provinces could form groups with executives and legislatures,  
and each group could be competent to determine the provincial subjects.

**4\. The Mountbatten Plan**

```
The plan for transfer of power to the Indians and partition of the country was laid down in
the Mountbatten Plan. It was given a formal shape by a statement made by the British
Government on June 3, 1947.
```

**5\. Indian Independence Act, 1947**

```
On February 20, 1947, the then British Prime Minister, Clement Atlee, declared that the
British rule in India would end by June 30, 1948. Other provisions of the Indian
Independence Act, 1947 were:
```

-   End of British rule in India was declared independent and sovereign.
    -   Partition of India and Pakistan.
    -   Abolition of the post of Viceroy and appointment of a Governor-General for both India  
        and Pakistan.
-   Empowering the Constituent Assemblies of both the dominions of India and Pakistan  
    with legislative and executive powers to frame and adopt a Constitution for their  
    respective nations.



## 4\. Salient Features of the Constitution of India Student Notes:^

**1\. Lengthiest Written Constitution**

```
The Indian Constitution is the lengthiest written Constitution in the world, among all
sovereign countries. In its original form, it consisted of 395 Articles and 8 Schedules, to
which changes have been made through subsequent amendments. As of January 2020 , the
Constitution of India consists of 4 70 articles in 25 parts, 12 schedules, and 5 appendices. As
of January 2020, there have been 126 Amendment Bills and 104 amendments of the
Constitution of India.
```

```
Written and Unwritten Constitution
Written constitution is one which is found in legal documents duly enacted in the form of laws.
It is precise, definite and systematic. It is the result of conscious and deliberate efforts of
people. It is framed by a representative body duly elected by people at a particular period in
history. It is always promulgated on a specific date in history. A written constitution is generally
rigid and a procedure separate from that of enacting ordinary law is provided for its
amendment or revision i.e. a distinction between constitutional law and ordinary law is
maintained. The first written constitution framed by a representative constituent assembly was
that of the United States of America. This example was followed by France. During 19th century
a number of states framed their constitutions, all of which were written, with the exception of
England. Indian constitution is an example of written constitution.
Unwritten constitution is the one in which no provisions or laws of the constitution are set in
writing but they are documented despite not being codified in a structured manner in a single
book. It consists of customs, conventions, traditions, and some written laws bearing different
dates. It is unsystematic, indefinite and un-precise. Such a constitution is not the result of
conscious and deliberate efforts of the people. It is generally the result of historical
development. It is not made by a representative constituent assembly at a definite stage of
history, nor is it promulgated on a particular date. It is, therefore, sometimes called an evolved
or cumulative constitution. The constitution of England is a classic example of an unwritten
constitution which is mainly a result of historical growth.
However, distinction between written and unwritten constitution is not scientific. There is no
constitution which is wholly written. Nor is there any which is completely unwritten. Every
written constitution has an unwritten element in it and every unwritten constitution has a
written element.
```

```
Point to be noted : Although the last article of the Constitution is Article 395, the total number,
as of January, 2020 is 4 70. New articles added through amendments have been inserted in the
relevant location in the original Constitution. In order not to disturb the original numbering, the
new articles are inserted with alphanumeric enumerations. For example, Article 21A pertaining
to Right to Education was inserted by the 86th Amendment Act.
```

There are various factors responsible for the length of the Constitution:

-   One of the major factors was that the framers of the Constitution borrowed provisions from  
    several sources and several other constitutions of the world.
-   Secondly, it was necessary to make provisions for issues particular to India, like the  
    scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and backward regions.
-   Thirdly, provisions were made for elaborate centre-state relations in all aspects of their  
    administrative and other activities.
-   Fourthly, since Indian states do not have a separate Constitution, provisions regarding the  
    state administration were also included in the Constitution of India.

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   Further, a detailed list of individual rights, directive principles of state policy and the details Student Notes:^  
    of administration procedure were laid down to make the Constitution clear and  
    unambiguous for the ordinary citizen.  
    **2\. Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility**

```
The Constitution of India is neither purely rigid nor purely flexible. There is a harmonious
blend of rigidity and flexibility. Some parts of the Constitution can be amended by the
ordinary law-making process of Parliament. However, certain provisions can be amended,
only when a Bill for that purpose is passed in each House of Parliament by a majority of the
total membership of that house and by a majority of not less than two-third of the
members of that house present and voting. Then there are certain other provisions, which
can be amended by the second method described above and must be further ratified by
the legislatures of not less than one-half of the states before being presented to the
President for his assent. It must also be noted that the power to initiate bills for
amendment lies with the Parliament alone, and not with the state legislatures.
```

However, SC has identified the limited power of Parliament to amend the Constitution as part  
of basic structure. In other words, parliament cannot amend each and every part of the  
constitution.

```
In Pandit Nehru’s words spoken in the Constituent Assembly: " While we want the
Constitution to be as solid and permanent as we can make it, there is no permanence in
Constitution. There should be certain flexibility. If you make anything rigid and permanent,
you stop the nation’s growth, the growth of a living, vital organic people....
In any event, we could not make this Constitution so rigid that it cannot be adapted to
changing conditions. When the world is in turmoil and we are passing through a very swift
period of transition, what we may do today may not be wholly applicable tomorrow ."
```

**3\. A Democratic Republic**

```
India is a democratic republic. It means that sovereignty rests with the people of India. They
govern themselves through their representatives, elected on the basis of universal adult
franchise. The President of India, the highest official of the state is elected for a fixed term.
Although, India is a sovereign republic, yet it continues to be a member of the
Commonwealth of Nations with the British Monarch as its head. Her membership of the
Commonwealth does not compromise her position as a sovereign republic. The
commonwealth is an association of free and independent nations. The British Monarch is
only a symbolic head of that association.
```

```
Concept of Parliamentary Sovereignty
```

```
Parliamentary Sovereignty: It is also known as parliamentary supremacy or legislative
supremacy. It makes Parliament the supreme legal authority, which can create or end any
law. Also, the judiciary cannot overrule legislation and no Parliament can pass laws that
future parliaments cannot change.
Parliamentary sovereignty stands at odds with:
```

-   The doctrine of constitutional supremacy,
-   The doctrine of separation of powers (limits the legislature's scope, often to general  
    law-making),
-   The doctrine of judicial review (laws passed by the legislature may be declared invalid  
    in certain circumstances).

```
Parliamentary sovereignty is a principle of the UK Constitution. It makes Parliament the
supreme legal authority in the UK.
```

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
Is the Indian Parliament sovereign? Student Notes:
```

```
The sovereign status of Indian Parliament is not absolute as in case of UK, because it is
subject to the provisions of the Constitution. That is to say, the Indian Parliament derives its
authority and power from the Constitution itself.
It has pre-defined limitations as defined below:
```

1.  The Parliament can enact laws with respect to only those matters, which are  
    enumerated either in the Union list or the Concurrent list.
2.  The laws made by Parliament are also subject to the power of judicial review of the  
    Supreme Court. That means that if a law made by Parliament goes against the  
    provisions of the Constitution, it can be declared null and void by the concerned court.

```
Thus, in India, the principle of supremacy of the Constitution has been adopted as against
the principle of supremacy of Parliament in UK.
```

**4\. Parliamentary Form of Government**

```
India has adopted the Westminster system, a democratic parliamentary system of
government modeled after the system followed in the United Kingdom. In this system, the
executive is responsible to the legislature, and remains in power only as long as it enjoys
the confidence of the legislature. The President of India, who remains in office for five
years, is the nominal, titular or constitutional head. The Union Council of Ministers, with
the Prime Minister as its head is drawn from the legislature. It is collectively responsible to
the House of People (Lok Sabha), and has to resign when it loses the confidence of that
house. The President, the nominal executive shall exercise his powers as per the advice of
the Union Council of Ministers, the real executive. In the states also, the government is
parliamentary in nature.
```

**5\. Mixture of Federal and Unitary Features**

```
Article 1 of the Constitution of India says: "India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States."
Though the word 'federation' is not used, India is a federal republic.
A state is federal when:
b) There are two sets of governments and there is distribution of powers between the
two;
c) There is a written Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land; and
d) There is an independent judiciary to interpret the Constitution and settle disputes
between the centre and the states.
```

```
All these features are present in India. There are two sets of government, one at the centre,
the other at state level and the distribution of powers between them is quite detailed in our
Constitution. The Constitution of India is written and is the supreme law of the land. At the
apex of a single integrated judicial system, stands the Supreme Court, which is independent
from the control of the executive and the legislature.
```

```
But, in spite of all these essential features of a federation, the Indian Constitution has
certain unitary tendencies. While other federations like USA provide for dual citizenship,
the India Constitution provides for single citizenship. There is also a single integrated
judiciary for the whole country. The provision of All India Services, like the Indian
Administrative Service, the Indian Police Service, and Indian Forest Service prove to be
another unitary feature. Members of these services are recruited by the Union Public
Service Commission on an all-India basis. Since these services are controlled by the Union
Government, to some extent this constitutes a constraint on the autonomy of States.
```

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
A significant unitary feature is the emergency provisions in the Indian Constitution. During Student Notes:
the time of emergency, the Union Government becomes even more powerful and the
Union Parliament acquires the power of making laws for the states. The Governor, placed as
the Constitutional head of the State, acts as the agent of the Centre and is intended to
safeguard the interests of the Centre. These provisions reveal the centralizing tendency of
our federation.
Prof K.C. Wheare has remarked that Indian Constitution provides, "a system of government
which is quasi-federal, a unitary state with the subsidiary unitary features".
The framers of the Constitution expressed clearly that there existed a harmony between
federalism and unitarism. Dr. Ambedkar said, "The political system adopted in the
Constitution could be both unitary as well as federal according to the requirement of time
and circumstances".
The Unites States was the first nation to have a truly federal Constitution and its federal
structure is still taken as the reference to judge whether any Constitution is federal or not.
However, the conditions under which different constitutions, especially the Indian
Constitution, were framed were much different from the conditions in America in 1787.
India, at the time of independence had already witnessed a messy partition and fissiparous
tendencies existed throughout the breadth of the country. Hence, a strong centre was the
need of the day to keep the state existing as a single unit and ultimately wield its people
together into a nation.
```

```
There are some centralising tendencies, but the Indian states also enjoy a fair degree of
power and autonomy. The Law Commission of India has also observed that there is no
dichotomy between a strong Union and strong states.
```

```
In S R Bommai case (1994), SC laid down that Constitution is federal and characterised
federalism as its ‘basic feature’. It observed that conferring greater power upon Centre does
not mean that states are mere appendages of Centre. They have an independent
constitutional existence. They are not satellites or agents of Centre. Within the sphere
allotted to them, the states are supreme. Federalism in the Constitution is not a matter of
administrative convenience but a matter of principle.
The above debate is probably best summarized in Prof. Alexanderowicz’s words that “India
is a federation but a federation sui generis”, i.e. a federation in a class of its own or a unique
federation.
```

```
To conclude, India has "Cooperative federalism" with central guidance and state
compliance. In recent times, the concept of “Competitive Federalism” has emerged where
the centre competes with states and vice-versa, and states compete with each other in
their joint efforts to develop India.
```

**6\. Fundamental Rights**

```
"A state is known by the rights it maintains", remarked Prof. H.J. Laski. The Constitution of
India affirms the basic principle that every individual is entitled to enjoy certain basic rights
and Part III of the Constitution deals with those rights, which are known as Fundamental
Rights. Originally there were seven categories of rights, but now they are six in number.
They are:
➢ Right to Equality,
➢ Right to Freedom,
➢ Right against Exploitation,
➢ Right to Freedom of Religion,
➢ Cultural and Educational rights and
➢ Right to Constitutional Remedies.
```

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
Right to property (Article-31), originally a Fundamental Right, has been removed by the Student Notes:
44th Amendment Act. 1978. It is now a legal right, but not a fundamental right.
```

```
Fundamental rights are described as negative obligations of the state and act as limitations
against the power of the state. Hence, they are negatively worded.
```

```
These fundamental rights are justiciable and the individual can move the higher judiciary,
which is the Supreme Court or the High Courts, if there is an encroachment on any of these
rights. The right to move to the Supreme Court directly for the enforcement of
Fundamental Rights has been guaranteed under Article 32 (Right to Constitutional
Remedies). However, the Fundamental Rights in India are not absolute. Reasonable
restrictions can be imposed keeping in view the security and other requirements of the
state and society.
```

**7\. Directive Principles of State Policy**

```
A novel feature of the Constitution is that it contains a chapter on the Directive Principles of
State Policy. These principles are in the nature of directives to the government of the day to
implement them for establishing social and economic democracy in the country.
```

```
It embodies important principles, like adequate means to livelihood, equal pay for both
men and women, distribution of wealth so as to sub serve the common good, free and
compulsory primary education, right to work, public assistance in case of old age,
unemployment, sickness and disablement, the organisation of Village Panchayats, special
care to the economically backward sections of the people etc. Most of these principles
could help in making India a welfare state. Though not justiciable, these principles have
been stated as "fundamental in the governance of the country".
```

**8\. Fundamental Duties**

```
A new Part, IV (A), following the Directive Principles of State Policy, was incorporated in the
Constitution by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976 for Fundamental Duties. The purpose of
incorporating the Fundamental Duties in the Constitution is to remind the people that while
enjoying their right as citizens, they should also perform their duties, since rights and duties
are correlated.
```

**9\. Secular State**

```
A secular state is neither religious nor irreligious, or anti-religious. Rather it is neutral in
matters of religion. India being a land of many religions, the founding fathers of the
Constitution thought it proper to make it a secular state. India is a secular state, because it
makes no discrimination between individuals on the basis of religion. It neither encourages
nor discourages any religion. On the contrary, the Right to Freedom of Religion is ensured in
the Constitution and people belonging to any religious group have the right to profess,
practice or propagate any religion they like.
```

**10\. Independent, Impartial and Integrated Judiciary**

```
The judiciary occupies an important place in our Constitution and it is also made
independent of the legislature and the executive. The Supreme Court of India stands at the
apex of a single integrated judicial system. It acts as a protector of fundamental rights of
Indian citizens and guardian of the Constitution. If any law passed by the legislature, or
action taken by the executive contravenes the provisions of the Constitution, they can be
declared as null and void by the Supreme Court. Thus, it has the power of judicial review.
```

**11\. Single Citizenship**

```
The Constitution of India recognizes only single citizenship. In the United States, there is
provision of dual citizenship. In India, we are citizens of India only, not of the respective
```

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
states to which we belong. This provision helps in promoting unity and integrity of the Student Notes:
nation and promotes fraternity among people of different regions.
```

**12\. Universal Adult Franchise**

```
The Article 326 of the Indian Constitution grants Universal Adult Suffrage/ Franchise,
according to which, all adult citizens above the age of 18 years, irrespective of their
religion, caste, race, colour and sex are entitled to cast vote and participate in the election
process.
```

**13\. Emergency Powers**

```
The emergency powers are introduced in the Indian Constitution so that the entire nation
can tackle any emergency situation, the country may be faced with. The emergency powers
are vested in the hands of the President of India. There are three kinds of Emergency
powers: National Emergency (Article352); Emergency in a State (Article 356) and Financial
Emergency (Article 360).
```

**14\. Separation of Powers**

```
The basic assumption behind the concept of separation of powers is that when power is
concentrated in the hands of one/few, it/they can subvert the state machinery to favour
individual or group interests over the common interest. The separation of powers is a way
of reducing the amount of power in any group’s hands, making it more difficult to abuse.
This doctrine claims that state power is not a single entity but rather a composite of
different governmental functions (i.e. legislative, executive, and judicial) carried out by state
bodies independently of each other. The legislature enacts laws; the executive enforces
those laws; and the judiciary interprets those laws.
The traditional views on separation of powers are presented by Montesquieu who
vigorously advocated for a “ strict or pure or total or complete or absolute” separation of
powers and personnel between three organs of the state i.e. the Executive, Legislature and
Judiciary; power being diffused between three separate bodies exercising separate
functions with no overlaps in function or personnel.
However, the Indian state represents a contemporary approach to the doctrine of
separation of powers. There is no strict separation of powers under our Constitution, both
in principle and practice. Since the executive or the council of ministers in parliamentary
democracies such as India or UK is also a part of the legislature, a rigid separation of powers
cannot exist.
India, in fact, has also adopted the doctrine of checks and balances along with the doctrine
of separation of powers. Under this doctrine, separate branches of the government viz.
legislature, executive, judiciary are empowered to keep each other in check. Hence in India,
each branch of the government, while performing its activities, does not seek to interfere in
the sphere of another branch, but at the same time seeks to ensure that the other branch is
not misusing its powers or exceeding its mandate. Thus, even when acting in ambit of their
own power, overlapping functions tend to appear amongst these organs.
```

```
An important question here is the relation among these three organs of the state, i.e.
whether there should be a complete separation of powers or should there be co-ordination
among them.
In the words of Dr. Durga Das Basu,
```

```
“So far as the courts are concerned, the application of the doctrine (the theory of
separation of powers) may involve two propositions: namely,
```

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
a) That none of the three organs of Government, Legislative Executive and Judicial, can Student Notes:
exercise any power which properly belongs to either of the other two;
b) That the legislature cannot delegate its powers.”
```

```
What is significant is the word “ properly ” and therefore conceives of a broad division of
powers where the core function is one, which is exclusively conferred on that particular
organ of State, though there may be some overlap in regard to the fringe areas of the topics
so entrusted. The pronouncement on this aspect of law by the courts is that under the
Indian Constitution there is a broad separation of powers.
```

**15\. Independent Bodies**

```
Indian Constitution not only provides for legislative, executive and judicial organs of
government (Central and state) but also establishes certain independent bodies like the
Election Commission, Comptroller and Auditor General of India and Union Public Service
Commission. They are envisaged by the Constitution as the bulwarks of the democratic
system of Government in India.
```

**16\. Three Tiers of Government**

```
Originally, the Indian Constitution, like any other federal constitution, provided for a dual
polity and contained provisions with regard to organisation and powers of the Centre and
the states. Later, the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts (1992) have added a
third-tier of government in form of Panchayats and Municipalities which is not found in any
other constitution of the world.
```

```
The above are some the important salient features of the Indian Constitution, which makes
it one of the most unique and distinct constitutions in the world.

    the statement (while discussing this, you have to assume that the statement holds  
    good.)
-   Also, provide examples of some constitutional amendments and discuss whether  
    changes have been too frequent, or only when situations arose that made these  
    inevitable.

**_Answer:_**

```
It is generally accepted that a Constitution should be a dynamic document. It should be
able to adapt itself to the changing needs of society. Sometimes under the impact of
new powerful social and economic forces, the pattern of government requires major
changes. As political practices change over time, adjustments to the constitutional text
keep it aligned with current practices and help ensure its continued relevance.
Constitutional change also gives the citizenry a say in how they are governed.
```

```
However, it must also be realized that the Constitution is not an instrument for the
government to restrain the people. Rather it is an instrument for the people to restrain
the government. If a Constitution is changed too often, it may lose its importance, since
the safeguards present may be gradually undone by amendments. This could make the
Constitution seem like any other law, and lead to erosion of its power. Thus, the basic
ideas -- separation of powers, checks and balances, limited government etc. must be
necessarily preserved.
```

```
The system of government we have, has plenty of flaws because it is run by people. But
the flaws can also be fixed without changing the Constitution. As Pt. Nehru
appropriately said, "The Constitution should not be changed too frequently. It must be
changed when the situation requires it to be changed".
Keeping these factors in mind, the draftsmen of the Indian Constitution incorporated
Article 368 in the Constitution. This article deals with the procedure of amendment of
the Constitution. It is due to Article 368 that the Indian Constitution can neither be
called rigid nor flexible, rather partly rigid and partly flexible.
Articles of the Indian Constitution can be amended through:
```

-   a simple majority in the Parliament;
-   special majority i.e. majority of the total membership of each house and majority of  
    not less than two thirds of the members of each house present and voting;
-   ratification by atleast half the State Legislatures, in addition to special majority.  
    Examples of a few major amendments, responding to needs of citizen and society:
-   The 52nd amendment to the Constitution added the Tenth Schedule, which laid  
    down the process by which legislators may be disqualified on grounds of defection.  
    The main intent of the law was to combat the evil of political defections, which  
    arises due to coalition politics.
-   The introduction of the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act institutionalized the  
    Panchayati Raj System. It unleashed the power of the grassroots, providing  
    representation to voiceless and disadvantaged sections. Thus it initiated India’s  
    largest exercise in democratic decentralization.  
    Some of the amendments have definitely improved the content and quality of the  
    constitutional document in the context of the changed and changing societal, economic  
    or political needs. Others were either inevitable or consequential for implementation of  
    policy decisions. However, there have also been quite a few which were avoidable,  
    unnecessary or motivated by merely political and partisan interest considerations of  
    the ruling majority party (for instance, the 42nd amendment act). In principle, the

majority in legislatures.
```

```
It needs to be understood that the growing disenchantment among public, relating to
governance, calls for remedies other than constitutional amendments. The most
important areas of reforms, in the electoral laws and processes and in political parties,
for example, need no constitutional changes. If there is political will legislation can be
passed to address the concerns as and when the need arises.

**2\. Though the Constitution-makers vested the power to amend the Constitution in the**  
**Parliament, since the Kesavananda Bharati case, the Supreme Court has become a**  
**decisive co-sharer in this power. Comment.**

**_Approach:_**

```
One should clearly bring out the situation pre Kesavananda Bharati case and how the
judgment changed the concept of amending the constitution. Brief elaboration of the
basic structure of the constitution is also important.
```

**_Answer:_**

```
Though the Constitution vested the power to amend the Constitution or any of its part
(Article 368) to the Parliament, which comprises of the representatives of the people,
the court in a landmark judgment adjudged that anything which contravenes the basic
structure of the constitution would be declare null and void thereby severely curtailing
the powers of the Parliament to amend the Constitution.
Article 368, on a plain reading did not contain any limitation on the power of the
Parliament to amend any part of the Constitution. In the Golak Nath Case, Supreme
Court was of the opinion that it should be read along with Article 13 of the Constitution
but it changed its decision in the Kesavananda Bharati case in 1973.
In Kesavananda Bharati Case, the Judiciary tried to deal with the question that “was the
power of the Parliament to amend the constitution unlimited?” Dealing with this
question, it came out with the basic structure doctrine through which it was held that
Parliament could amend any part of the constitution so along as it did not alter or
amend the basic structure of the constitution.
The Supreme Court has not explicitly mentioned what constitutes the ‘basic structure’,
further casting a doubt whether any legislation if challenged will pass the judicial
scrutiny or not.
But it could be deciphered from subsequent judgments that Preamble, Federalism,
Fundamental Rights, Secularism etc. are some of its basic components.
As one commentator has opined – the reality of constitutionalism has been that the
legislature and the judiciary are likely to remain Competitors when it comes to
interpreting the Constitution. It is by no means settled who has the final word. The
parliament can pass any legislation and the court can determine its constitutionality,
the Parliament could try to circumvent the court by amending the constitution, the
court can pronounce Parliament has limited powers and so on.
There are examples of enactments, which got nullified for violating the basic structure
while others like the abolition of Right to property by 44th AA passed the judicial
scrutiny.
In conclusion, it can be said that the decline of the Parliament in relation to other
competing institution of government is most empathetically felt on the Parliament’s
loss to the judiciary as the locus of the Constituent Power.

**_3\. Indian constitution is a borrowed constitution. Evaluate._** Student Notes:

**_Approach:_**

```
Give your verdict as to what extent the statement that Indian Constitution is a
borrowed constitution, is true and whether you agree with this assertion. Take
evidence from sources, which both support and contradict the assertion. Thereafter
come to a conclusion, basing your decision on what you consider to be the most
important factors and try to justify the stand you have taken.
```

**_Answer:_**

```
Though the framers of the Constitution of India borrowed many ideas from the then
existing Constitution, but this was not a slavish imitation of the west. Rather, each
provision of the Constitution had to be logically defended and argued upon to show
how it was suited to the problems and aspirations of the citizens of India.
While our constitution has been called as a ‘borrowed’ Constitution by some, its
framers, as a matter of fact, must be credited for gathering the best features of each of
the then existing Constitutions and modifying them with a view to avoid the faults that
had been disclosed in their working. Moreover, the Constitution was adapted to suit to
the existing condition and needs of the country.
Further, the constitution of India is unique in so many ways that it becomes difficult to
fit it in any one particular model. For instance, it is a blend of rigidity and flexibility,
federal and unitary features, presidential and parliamentary democracy etc.
```

```
While the structural part of the constitution, was to a large extent, derived from the
Government of India Act, 1935; its philosophical part had many other sources:
```

```
U.K. : Nominal Head-President, Cabinet system of ministers, Post of Prime Minister,
Parliamentary type of government, Bicameral Parliament, the Lower House being more
powerful, Council of Ministers responsible to Lower House, Speaker in Lok Sabha.
```

```
USA : Written constitution, Executive head of state, known as President and him being
the supreme commander of armed forces, Vice President as the ex- officio chairman of
Rajya Sabha, Fundamental Rights, Supreme Court, Provision of States, Preamble,
Independence of judiciary and judicial review.
```

```
USSR : Fundamental Duties, five year plan.
Australia : Concurrent list, Language of Preamble, Provision regarding trade , commerce
and intercourse
Germany : Suspension of fundamental rights during emergency
Canada : Scheme of federation with strong centre, Distribution of powers between
centre and the states and placing residuary powers with the centre
Ireland : Concept of Directive Principles of States Policy, Method of election of
President.
Despite these, examples of modifications and innovations in Indian constitution
abound. Consider, for instance, the following features of the Indian Constitution:
```

1.  The Indian Constitution is a unique blend of rigidity and flexibility: Though Indian  
    constitution is a written constitution, it is not as rigid as the American constitution.
2.  Judicial Review: Judiciary in USA has absolute power of judicial review, whereas  
    Britain has Parliamentary supremacy. Indian Constitution effects a compromise  
    between the Doctrines of parliamentary Sovereignty and judicial supremacy.

3.  Fundamental rights though influenced by USA’s Bill of Right have certain Student Notes:  
    differences:
    -   Unlike fundamental rights mentioned in the Indian Constitution, declarations in  
        the American Bill of Right are absolute
    -   There are no unenumerated rights under our constitution. Fundamental Rights  
        under our Constitution are exhaustively enumerated in Part 3 of the  
        constitution
4.  Besides these, we have also many indigenous and innovative features like  
    Panchayats, international peace, and security.  
    Thus, while some ideas may have been borrowed from other constitutions of the world,  
    it may not be correct to call the Indian Constitution as a borrowed constitution per se.  
    **_4\. Amendment process of the Indian constitution with that of Japan._**

**_Answer:_**

```
a) India: The constitution is more flexible than rigid. Only the amendment of few of
the provisions of the constitution requires ratification by state legislatures and even
then legislation by not less than half of the states would suffice. The rest of the
constitution could be amended by a special majority by parliament. There is no
separate constituent body provided for by our constitution for the amending
process.
```

```
Japan: Japan’s constitution is rigid. Article 96 provides that amendments can be
made to any part of the constitution. However, a proposed amendment must first
be approved by both houses of the Diet, by at least two-thirds majority of each
house. It must then be submitted to a referendum in which it is sufficient for it to
be endorsed by a simple majority of votes cast. A successful amendment is finally
promulgated by the Emperor, but the monarch cannot veto an amendment.

## 1\. Introduction Student Notes:^

The term ‘preamble’ refers to the introduction or preface to the Constitution. It contains the  
summary or essence of the Constitution. The ideals behind the Preamble were laid down by  
Jawaharlal Nehru’s Objectives Resolution, adopted by the Constituent Assembly on January 22,

The Preamble to a written Constitution states the objects, which the Constitution seeks to  
establish. It also promotes and aids the legal interpretation of the Constitution, where the  
language is found to be ambiguous. Therefore, for a proper appreciation of the aims and  
aspirations embodied in our Constitution, we need to turn to the various expressions contained  
in the Preamble.

The Preamble to the Constitution of India states:

```
“We, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a
SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:
```

```
JUSTICE, social, economic and political;
LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;
```

```
EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all;
FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the
Nation:
IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do HEREBY
ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.”
```

The Preamble to our Constitution serves, two purposes:

```
a) It indicates the source from which the Constitution derives its authority;
b) It also states the objects, which the Constitution seeks to establish and promote.
```

## 2\. Key Words in the Preamble

### 2 .1. Sovereign

The term _Sovereignty_ refers to the independent authority of a State. It means that the State has  
the power to legislate on any subject; and that it is not subject to the control of any external  
power.

Consequently, the term _Sovereign_ in the Preamble of India implies that India is neither a  
dependency nor a dominion of any other nation, but an independent state. There is no  
authority above it, and it is free to conduct its own affairs, both internal and external.

India’s declaration to continue her full membership of the Commonwealth of Nations in 1949  
does not affect India’s sovereignty in any manner. This declaration is _extra-legal_ and there is no  
mention of it in the Constitution. It is a voluntary declaration and indicates a free association  
and no obligation. This association was an honorable association between independent states.  
It accepts the crown of England only as a _symbolic_ head of the Commonwealth, and having no  
claim to the allegiance of citizens of India. As Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru explained:

_“It is an agreement by free will, to be terminated by free will”_

#### 2 .1.1. Sovereignty and Globalization

India has always been a supporter of international institutions. It is a founding member of the  
United Nations. It has also actively participated in evolution of international law. Does this  
compromise sovereignty of our nation?

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

It has to be realized that sovereignty is a legal fiction. In practice, it is often compromised. Student Notes:  
However, the view that globalization **dilutes** sovereignty needs to be revisited. Globalization is  
not a dilution of sovereignty, but a modification of the manner in which sovereignty is  
exercised. Globalization requires a more responsible use of sovereignty.

The Government of India continues to ensure its strategic autonomy in international sphere and  
is vigilant in protecting the interests of the people of India. The recent debate in WTO with  
regards to the food subsidy is a case in point.

### 2 .2. Socialist

The Constitution had a socialist content in the form of certain Directive Principles of State Policy  
(esp. Arts. 39(b) and 39(c)), even before the term was added by the 42nd Amendment Act in

1976.  However, the ‘socialism’ envisaged by the Indian Constitution is not the usual scheme of  
    State socialism, which involves ‘nationalisation’ of all means of production, and the abolition of  
    private property. Instead, Indian Socialism is ‘democratic Socialism’, influenced by Fabianism. It  
    is a peaceful gradual transformation of the society in participation with the state and not  
    against the state.

Though the word ‘Socialism’ may seem to be vague, our Supreme Court has observed that its  
principal aim is to eliminate inequality of income and status and standards of life, and to  
provide a decent standard of life to the working people. The Indian Constitution, therefore,  
does not seek to abolish private property altogether but seeks to put it under restraints so that  
it may be used in the interests of the nation, which includes the upliftment of the poor. Instead  
of a total nationalization of all property and industry, it envisages a ‘mixed economy’, where  
both private and public sector grow side by side.

However, some have argued that the Indian state is deviating from its path of Socialism. The  
following have been cited as reasons behind this line of argument:

-   Adoption of neo-liberal economic policy: The new economic policy (1991) of liberalization,  
    privatization and globalization has diluted the socialist credentials of the Indian state.
-   From 1991 onwards, the trend has been away from socialism to privatization. Investment in  
    many public enterprises has been divested in favour of private persons. Many industries  
    and services, which were reserved for the government sector have been thrown open for  
    private enterprise.
-   Growth, which happened after the reforms of 1990s exacerbated inter-state and intra-state  
    disparities. Further, this growth has been without any meaningful job creation. (Jobless  
    growth)
-   The Indian state has failed to end mass poverty

However, it should be noted that these developments have been in keeping with the worldwide  
trend after the collapse of socialism in the USSR and East European countries. Also, the  
constitutional obligation to pay compensation to the private owner for State acquisition has  
been taken away by repealing Art. 31 by the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, 1978. Further,  
the limitations of the neo-liberal economic model are being realized and the ideal of inclusive  
growth has been brought back into the fold of policy making.

### 2 .3. Secular

The Constitution guaranteed secular polity through various constitutional provisions, even  
before the term was added in 1976. The unity and fraternity of the people of India, professing  
numerous faiths, has been sought to be achieved by enshrining the ideal of a ‘secular state’. A  
secular state, in the context of India, means that the State protects all religions equally and  
does not uphold any religion as the State religion. The term “secular” was added by the 42nd  
Amendment Act, 1976.

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

This is one of the glowing achievements of Indian democracy given that her neighbors such as Student Notes:  
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, uphold particular religions as State religions.

The reasons for the necessity of secularism in India are as follows:

-   India is a heterogeneous society.
-   The idea of India as a secular state has been challenged by states like Pakistan.
-   We may be subjected to international propaganda (terrorism and related problems).

#### 2 .3.1. Constitutional Provisions Regarding Secularism

-   The Indian state has no religion.
-   All citizens are equal in the eyes of the law. Articles 14, 15 and 27 establish the secular  
    nature of the state. Article 15 is a specific instruction that the state shall not discriminate  
    among the citizens only on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.  
    Affirmative action is allowed, but not on the grounds of religion only.
-   Fundamental Rights mentioned in Arts. 25–28 guarantee to all individuals, the freedom to  
    profess, practice and propagate their religion, and assure strict impartiality on the part of  
    the state and its institutions towards all religions.
-   Religion is subordinate to the state rather than the state being subordinate to the religion.  
    It also implies that the state can interfere in religious affairs for the purpose of social  
    reforms.
-   A special feature of Indian secularism emerging from historical context is that special  
    protection is granted to the minorities with respect to the conservation of their culture and  
    traditions.

### 2 .4. Democratic

The ‘democratic republic’, which the Preamble envisages is democratic not only from a political  
standpoint but also from a social standpoint. Thus, it envisages not only a democratic form of  
government but also a democratic society, infused with the spirit of ‘justice, equality and  
fraternity’.

The form of government envisaged by our Constitution is a representative democracy. The  
people of India are to exercise sovereignty through the Parliament at the Centre and Legislature  
in each State, which are elected on the basis of universal adult franchise. The real Executive,  
namely the Council of Ministers, shall be responsible to the Parliament. Though there shall be  
an elected President at the head of the Union and a Governor nominated by the President at  
the head of each state, neither of them can exercise any political function without the advice of  
Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the people’s  
representatives in the respective Legislatures (excepting the functions which the Governor is  
authorized by the Constitution itself to discharge in his discretion or on his individual  
responsibility).

In essence, Parliamentary democracy envisages the following:

-   Representation of People
-   Responsible Government
-   Accountability of the Council of Ministers to the Legislature

### 2 .5. Republic

A democratic polity can be classified into two categories – monarchy and republic. In a  
monarchy, the head of the state (usually king or queen) enjoys a hereditary position (example:  
Britain, Japan). In a republic, the head of the state is always elected directly or indirectly for a  
fixed period (example: US, India)

The Preamble declares that source of all authority under the Constitution is the people of India

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

and there is no subordination to any external authority. While, Pakistan remained a British Student Notes:  
Dominion until 1956, India ceased to be a dominion and declared herself a ‘Republic’ since  
enacting the Constitution in 1949.

We have an elected President as the Head of State and all offices including that of the President  
are open to all citizens.

### 2.6. Liberty

The term liberty means an absence of restraints on the activities of individuals and at the same  
time, providing opportunities for the development of individual personalities.

The Constitution secures to all citizens liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship  
through Fundamental Rights, which are enforceable in Court of Law. However, reasonable  
restrictions are placed on liberty by the Constitution itself.

The ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity are taken from the French Revolution.

### 2.7. Equality

The term ‘equality’ means absence of special privileges to any section of the society and the  
provision of adequate opportunities for all individuals without any discrimination.

The Preamble secures to all citizens equality of status and opportunity. This provision embraces  
three dimensions of equality – civic, political and economic.

The following Fundamental Rights ensure **civic equality** :

-   Equality before Law (Art. 14)
-   Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth (Art.
    
-   Abolition of Untouchability (Art. 17)
-   Abolition of titles (Art. 18)

There are two provisions in the Constitution, which seek to achieve **political equality:**

-   No person is to be declared ineligible for inclusion in electoral rolls on the grounds of  
    religion, race, caste or sex (Art. 325).
-   Elections to the Lok Sabha and the state assemblies are to be conducted on the basis of  
    adult suffrage (Art. 326).

The following provisions seek to achieve **economic equality**

-   The Directive Principles (Art. 39) secure to men and women equal right to an adequate  
    means of livelihood and equal pay for equal work.
-   Equality of Opportunity in matters of public employment (Article 16)

### 2.8. Fraternity

Fraternity means a sense of brotherhood. The Constitution promotes this feeling of fraternity  
by the system of single citizenship. Also, the Fundamental Duties (Art. 51A) say that it shall be  
the duty of every citizen to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst  
all people of India transcending religious, linguistic, regional and sectoral diversities.

According the Preamble, fraternity assures two things – the dignity of the individual and the  
integrity of the nation. The word ‘integrity’ was added by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976.

According to K.M Munshi, the phrase ‘dignity of the individual’ signifies that the Constitution  
not only ensures material betterment and maintains a democratic set-up, but that it also  
recognizes that the personality of every individual is sacred.

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

The phrase ‘unity and integrity of the nation’ embraces both psychological and territorial Student Notes:  
dimensions of national integration. Art. 1 of the Constitution describes India as a ‘Union of  
States’ to make it clear that the States have no right to secede from the Union, implying the  
indestructible nature of the Indian Union. It aims at overcoming hindrances to national  
integration like communalism, regionalism, casteism, secessionism etc.

**Trinity – Liberty Equality and Fraternity**

According to Dr. BR Ambedkar, these principles of liberty, equality and fraternity are not to be  
treated as separate items in a trinity. They form a union of trinity in the sense that to divorce  
one from the other is to defeat the very purpose of democracy. Liberty cannot be divorced from  
equality, equality cannot be divorced from liberty. Nor can liberty and equality be divorced from  
fraternity.

Without equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Equality  
without liberty would kill individual initiative. Without fraternity, liberty would produce the  
supremacy of the few over the many. Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative.  
Without fraternity, liberty and equality could not become a natural course of things. It would  
require a constable to enforce them.

Together these principles would help us ensure our vision of social democracy which is very  
important for political democracy as well. Political democracy cannot last unless there lies at  
the base of it social democracy.

### 2.9. Justice

Justice, as a concept involves fair, moral, and impartial treatment of all persons. In its most  
general sense, it means according individuals what they actually deserve or merit, or are in  
some sense, entitled to.

The term ‘justice’ as imbibed in the Preamble embraces three distinct forms –social, economic  
and political. These are secured through various provisions of Fundamental Rights and Directive  
Principles.

Social justice denotes equal treatment of all citizens without any distinction based on caste,  
color, race, religion, sex and so on. It means absence of privileges to any section of the society  
and at the same time making provisions for the improvement of backward sections (SCs, STs  
and OBCs) and women.

Economic justice denotes non-discrimination between people on the basis of economic factors.  
It involves the elimination of glaring inequalities in wealth, income and property.

Political justice implies that all citizens should have equal political rights, equal access to all  
political offices and equal voice in the government.

The ideal of justice – social, economic and political has been taken from the Russian Revolution.

## 3\. Status of the Preamble

### 3 .1. Traditional View

The traditional view is that it is not a necessary part of the Constitution, but an ornamental  
part. This means that if we drop it from the statute, it will not impact the provisions of the law  
or enactment.

### 3 .2. Modern View

The modern view is that the Preamble is a part of the Constitution and it is subject to  
amendment by the Parliament.

### 3 .3. Status of The Preamble in India Student Notes:^

#### 3 .3.1. Berubari Union Case, 1960

-   The Supreme Court said that the Preamble shows the general purposes behind the several  
    provisions in the Constitution, and is thus a key to the minds of the makers of the  
    Constitution. Further, where the terms used in any article are ambiguous or capable of  
    more than one meaning, some assistance at interpretation may be taken from the  
    objectives enshrined in the Preamble.
-   Despite this **recognition of the significance of the Preamble** , the Supreme Court held that  
    the Preamble is **not a part of the Constitution**. It is also not the source to prohibit the  
    power, which is given explicitly in the Constitution. Further, the Preamble is not enforceable  
    in a Court of Law.

#### 3 .3.2. Kesavananda Bharaticase, 1973

In the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), the Supreme Court rejected the earlier opinion (in the  
Berubari Case) and held that the Preamble is **a part of the Constitution**. It observed that the  
Preamble is of extreme importance and the Constitution should be read and interpreted in the  
light of the grand and noble vision expressed in the Preamble.

Explanation provided by the Supreme Court:

-   The Preamble may not be an essential part of ordinary statute, but it is an essential part of  
    Constitutional Law.
-   Supreme Court admitted that a few facts regarding the Preamble were not noticed in the  
    Berubari Case. These facts established Preamble as a part of the Constitution.  
    o It has been adopted by the Constituent Assembly in the same manner as other parts.  
    o The motion by which the Preamble was adopted said: “The question is that Preamble  
    stands part of the Constitution”.  
    o The Preamble was enacted after rest of the Constitution was already enacted. The  
    Preamble was inserted in the end to ensure that there is no inconsistency between the  
    Preamble and other provisions of the Constitution. This was unlike USA where the  
    Preamble was enacted first.

#### 3 .3.3. S R Bommai Case, 1994

-   The Supreme Court again held that the Preamble is an integral part of the Constitution.

## 4\. Amendability of the Preamble

The question regarding the amendability of the Preamble was raised in the Kesavananda  
Bharati Case (1973). The argument of the petitioner was that the Preamble is not a provision of  
the Constitution, hence it cannot be amended.

Supreme Court’s view: Preamble is an essential and integral part of the Constitution. Hence, it  
can be amended; otherwise the harmony of the Constitution may get disturbed. It held that the  
Preamble could be amended, subject to the condition that no amendment is done to the ‘basic  
features’ of the Constitution.

Consequently the Preamble was amended by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976. It added three  
new words: **Socialist, Secular and Integrity** to the Preamble.

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   The Preamble cannot be invoked when the provisions of the Constitution are explicit. (A. K Student Notes:^  
    Gopalan case, 1950). In the Gopalan case, the SC clarified that the Preamble will not be  
    invoked to explain or interpret explicit provisions. In this case, the SC held that the term  
    ‘law’ used in Article 21 (life & liberty) denotes a ‘law made by the State’ and not ‘natural  
    law’.
-   It however acknowledged that the Preamble may be used if there is an ambiguity in the  
    provisions of the Constitution. According to the SC, Preamble is the key to unlock the minds  
    of the Constituent Assembly.

### 5 .2. Kesavananda Bharati Case

-   Preamble is of extreme importance and the Constitution should be read and interpreted in  
    the light of the grand and noble vision expressed in the Preamble.
-   SC clarified that Preamble can be used in the interpretation of the relationship between  
    Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles.
-   SC utilized the above approach in examining the validity of 25th Amendment Act, 1971,  
    which added Article 31C.

**_1\. In light of the controversy over Preamble, discuss the views that have emerged on its_**  
**_status and amendablity. In this context, discuss the purpose that the Preamble to the_**  
**_Constitution serves in our polity._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Briefly discuss about Preamble of the constitution.
-   Discuss the status of Preamble and its amendability as opined by the Supreme  
    Court in various cases.
-   Briefly discuss the recent controversy..
-   Discuss the purposes served by the preamble of the constitution in Indian polity.  
    **_Answer:_**

```
The Preamble embodies the basic philosophy and fundamental values on which the
Constitution is based. After independence, one of the controversies about the
Preamble is as to whether it is a part of the Constitution or not. Judiciary in different
cases provided different interpretations. For example:
```

-   In the Berubari Union case, the Supreme Court said that the Preamble shows  
    the general purposes behind the several provisions in the Constitution,  
    however, didn’t consider it as a part of the Constitution.
-   In the Kesavananda Bharati case, the Supreme Court rejected the earlier opinion  
    and held that Preamble is a part of the constitution.

```
Amendability of Preamble:
```

-   In Keshvanandan Bharti case, SC upheld that Preamble can be amended, subject to  
    the condition that the amendment doesn’t alter the basic structure of the  
    constitution.

```
The preamble has been amended only once so far in 1976 by 42nd constitutional
Amendment Act which added three new words – socialist, secular and integrity to the
preamble.
```

```
Recently, a controversy regarding the status of the preamble erupted after the
government issued an advertisement where the original preamble of the constitution
was mentioned, which did not contain the words Secular and Socialist. The controversy
can largely be considered as a political gimmick by parties as a tool for vote bank. This
can be understood from the following points:
```

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   Secularism is a basic feature of Indian constitution as opined by the SC. The status Student Notes:^  
    of India as a secular state is established under Article 25. The substance of  
    secularism lies in fundamental rights and not the preamble.
-   The significance of the word Socialist state has been diluted significantly as the  
    economy today is dominated by the private sector.

```
Significance of Preamble in Indian Polity:
```

-   It embodies the source of the Constitution i.e., the people of India.
-   The terms sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic in the Preamble  
    suggests the nature of the state.
-   The ideals of justice, liberty, equality, fraternity reflects the objectives of the  
    Constitution.
-   It contains the grand and noble vision of the Constituent Assembly, and reflects the  
    dreams and aspirations of the founding fathers of the Constitution. Thus it is also a  
    guiding source for the judges to understand the minds of founding fathers.  
    **_2\. Stating the preamble to the Indian constitution comment on its nature and scope._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Briefly explain the crux of the Preamble.
-   Discuss its nature and the role it plays in our Constitution.
-   Discuss its scope that encompasses various aims and objectives of the Constitution.

**_Answer:_**

```
The Preamble to the Indian Constitution states: ‘We, the people of India, having
solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN, SOCIALIST, SECULAR,
DEMOCRATIC, REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens
```

```
JUSTICE social, economic and political;
LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;
```

```
EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all;
FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the
nation;
```

```
In our Constituent Assembly, this 26th day of November, 1949, do HEREBY ADOPT,
ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.’
```

```
Nature of the Preamble
The Preamble outlines the aims of the Constitution makers and aspirations of our
founding fathers. It envisions India as a democratic Republic not only from the political
but also from the social standpoint i.e. a democratic society which seeks both economic
as well as social justice.
```

```
The Preamble declares that India being an independent and sovereign democratic
republic has the power to legislate on any subject and that it is not subject to the
control of any other State or external power. The term ‘Republic’ connotes that we have
an elected President as the Head of the State and all offices, including that of the
President, are open to all its citizens.
```

```
The unity and fraternity of the people of India, professing numerous faiths, has been
sought to be achieved by enshrining the ideal of a secular state, which means that the
State protects all religions equally and does not itself uphold any religion as state

```
religion. Also, the Preamble states that people are the ultimate authority and the Student Notes:
Constitution emerges from them.
```

```
Scope of the Preamble
Unlike the Constitution of Australia, Canada or the U.S.A., the Constitution of India has
an elaborate Preamble. The Preamble does not grant any power but it gives direction
and purpose to the Constitution. It serves as a guiding light for holistic understanding of
the Indian Constitution.
```

```
It envisages for citizen’s liberty, equality and fraternity which has to be secured and
protected along with social justice, economic empowerment and political justice.
```

```
Though Preamble is a part of the Constitution and is not enforceable in a Court of Law
by itself, nonetheless it aids in the legal interpretation of the Constitution where
language is found to be ambiguous. Further, the scope and utility of the Preamble has
been pointed out in several decisions of the Supreme Court where it held that the
Preamble defines the ‘Basic structure’ of our Constitution and imposes a limitation on
the misuse of the amending power of legislatures.
```

**_3\. The philosophical underpinnings of the Indian constitution can be best understood_**  
**_through its preamble inspired by the Objectives Resolution in the constituent_**  
**_assembly. Elaborate._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Discuss the broad features of the historic Objectives Resolution.
-   Highlight how the resolution reflects itself in the Indian Constitution, especially the  
    Preamble of the Constitution.
-   Discuss, in detail, how the Preamble informs the basic philosophical framework of  
    the Indian Constitution.
-   Conclude on the basis of the aforementioned points  
    **_Answer:_**  
    The Preamble is the keynote to the Constitution, that embodies the basic philosophy  
    and fundamental values on which our Constitution is based. It draws heavily from the  
    vision of the founding fathers of our Constitution, as documented in the historic  
    Objectives Resolution adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 22nd January, 1947.

```
Preamble as a derivative of the Objectives Resolution:
The historic Objectives Resolution envisioned the sovereign republic of India, as a
union of states that derives its power & authority from the people. It also delved into
aspects of the division of powers between the states and the Union. It guaranteed and
secured social, economic and political justice ; equality of status and opportunities and
equality before law; and fundamental freedoms – of speech, expression, belief, faith,
worship, vocation, association and action – subject to law and public morality. Besides,
it assured provision of safeguards for minorities, backward classes and tribals as well.
Preamble as the philosophical framework guiding the Indian Constitution:
The Preamble is a guiding light to the minds of the makers of our Constitution. For a
proper appreciation of the aims & aspirations embodied in our Constitution, we must
turn to the expressions contained in the Preamble.
```

-   **Sovereign:** The Preamble envisages a sovereign India that is free to conduct its own  
    affairs without control from any other state or external power.
-   **Republic:** It means vesting of **political sovereignty in the people** and thus India has  
    an elected head called the President.

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   **Democratic:** It envisages not just political but social democracy as well. Student Notes:^  
    Consequently, the Indian Constitution provides for a parliamentary democracy that  
    is representative, responsible, and accountable and that stands for the good of all  
    people.
-   **Justice:** The ideal of **political, economic and social justice** enshrined in the  
    Preamble is sought to be achieved through universal adult suffrage, creation of  
    welfare state, removal of social inequalities etc.
-   **Liberty:** The Preamble mentions certain minimal rights to every member of the  
    society, as essential for a **free and civilised existence**. The Constitution guarantees  
    these rights against all authorities of the state in the form of freedom of thought,  
    belief, expression, faith and worship **\[Articles 19, 25-28\]** subject to certain  
    restrictions like morality, public health and order etc.
-   **Equality:** The ideals of **equality of status and opportunity** envisaged by the  
    Preamble are guaranteed by the Constitution that seeks to banish all inequality  
    through **fundamental right to equality \[Articles 14-18\]** , directive principles of the  
    state policy **\[Article 39\]** and other similar provisions.
-   **Fraternity:** The Preamble calls for a spirit of brotherhood amongst all sections of  
    people. This has sought to be achieved by enshrining the ideals of a **‘secular’** state.  
    Besides, the Constitution assures the **dignity of the individual** through provision of  
    justiciable fundamental rights and certain directives like **Article 39(a), 42 & 43**. By  
    including **Article 51A** , the Constitution makes it a fundamental duty of the citizens  
    to uphold the **unity & integrity of the nation**.  
    Thus, we see that the ideals contained in the Objectives Resolution, were embodied in  
    the Preamble. These ideals went on to shape the political philosophy of the Indian  
    Constitution in subsequent stages. Consequently, these determined the nature and  
    course of the India in the forthcoming years as a liberal, democratic, egalitarian and  
    secular nation.

## 1\. Constitutional Provision: Article 1-4 (Part-I) Student Notes:^

Articles 1 to 4 under Part-I of the Constitution deal with the Union and its territory.

### 1.1. Article 1

-   Article 1(1) – India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.
-   Article 1(2) – The states and territories thereof shall be as specified in the First Schedule.
-   Article 1(3) – The territory of India shall comprise:  
    o The territories of the States  
    o The Union territories specified in First Schedule; and  
    o Such other territories as may be acquired.

#### 1.1.1. Federation Versus Union

The Drafting Committee had a purpose while choosing the word “Union”, in preference to  
“Federation”. They were of the view that the word “Union” better expresses the fact that the  
Union of India is not the outcome of an agreement among the old provinces and it is not open  
to any State or a group of States to secede from the Union or to vary the boundary of their  
States on their own free will.

The Federation is a Union because it is **indestructible.** Though the country and the people can  
be divided into different States for convenience of administration, the country is one integral  
whole, its people living under a single imperium derived from a single source.

#### 1.1.2. Territory of India

The territory of India, which is described in clause (3) falls under three categories:

```
(i) State Territories
(ii) Union Territories
(iii) Territories which may be acquired by the Government of India
```

The names of States and Union Territories and their territorial extent are mentioned in the first  
schedule of the Constitution. At present, there are 2 8 states and 8 union territories.

The expression ‘Union of India’ should be distinguished from the expression ‘Territory of India’.  
While the former includes only states which enjoy the status of being member of the federal  
system and share a distribution of powers with the Union, the “territory of India” includes the  
entire territory over which the sovereignty of India, for the time, extends and such territories  
are directly administered by the Central Government.

A territory can be said to have been acquired when the Indian Union acquires sovereignty over  
such territory according to the modes recognized by International law, i.e. purchase, treaty,  
cession or conquest. If there was any public notification, assertion or declaration by which the  
Government of India had declared or treated a territory as part and parcel of India, the Courts  
would be bound to recognise an ‘acquisition’ as having taken place, with the consequence that  
the territory would be part of the territory of the Union within Article 1(3)(c).

### 1.2. Article 2

**Parliament may by law admit into the Union, or establish, new States on such terms and  
conditions as it thinks fit.**

There are two powers given to Parliament by Article 2, namely:

```
(i) The power to admit new States into the Union; and
(ii) The power to establish new States.
```

The first refers to the admission of duly organised political communities (states which are

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

already in existence), while the second to the formation of state where none existed before, i.e. Student Notes:  
Article 2 refers to the admission or establishment of new states **that are not part of the Union  
of India**. Parliament admitted the French settlements of Pondicherry, Karaikal, etc. by using this  
power.

Further, it should be noted that Article 2 gives complete discretion to Parliament to admit or  
establish new States on such terms and conditions as “it thinks fit”. Such terms and conditions  
must, however, be consistent with the foundational principles or the basic structure of the  
Constitution. There is nothing in the Constitution, which would entitle a new State, after its  
formation or admission into the Union, to claim complete equality of status with an existing  
state.

### 1.3. Article 3

**Formation of new States and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing States**

Parliament may by law:

```
i. Form a new State by separation of territory from any State or by uniting two or more
States or parts of States or by uniting any territory to a part of any State;
ii. Increase the area of any State
iii. Diminish the area of any State
iv. Alter the boundaries of any State
v. Alter the name of any State
```

**A Bill under Article 3 must satisfy 2 conditions:**

-   It shall be introduced in either House of Parliament only on the recommendation of the  
    President.
-   If the proposal contained in the Bill affects the area, boundaries or name of any of the  
    States, the Bill has to be referred by the President to the Legislature of the State for  
    expressing its views thereon. The President shall specify the period within which the State  
    Legislature must express its views. If the views of the State Legislature are not received  
    within the specified or extended period, the second condition stands fulfilled.

The President (or Parliament) is not bound by the views of the State Legislature and may either  
accept or reject them, even if the views are received in time. Further, it is not necessary to  
make a fresh reference to the State Legislature every time an amendment to the bill is moved  
and accepted in Parliament.

Article 3 empowers the Parliament to alter the territory or integrity of the states without their  
consent or concurrence, which differentiates the Indian Federal system with that of the  
traditional system. In other words, the Parliament can redraw the political map of India  
according to its will. Hence, the territorial integrity or continued existence of any state is not  
guaranteed by the Constitution. Therefore, India is rightly described as **“an indestructible  
Union of destructible states”**.

While in America, where the federal system is the result of a compact or agreement between  
independent states, it is obvious that the agreement could not be altered without the consent  
of states, who are party to it. That is why American Federation has been described as **“an  
indestructible Union of indestructible States”.**

In the Indian context, DD Basu argues that such liberal powers were granted to the Indian  
Parliament because the grouping of the Provinces under the Government of India Acts was  
based on historical and political reasons rather than social, cultural and linguistic divisions of  
the people themselves. The question of reorganising the units according to natural alignments  
was indeed raised at the time of making of the Constitution but, then, there was not enough  
time to undertake the huge task, considering the magnitude of the problem.

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

There are instances where the State Legislatures have passed resolution for creating new states. Student Notes:  
But constitutionally, states cannot initiate the process of creation of states etc. It has to start  
from the Union Council of Ministers advising the President to recommend the introduction of  
the Bill in the Parliament. The motion passed by Uttar Pradesh Assembly in November 2011, to  
divide the state into 4 parts – Poorvanchal, Paschim Pradesh, Awadh Pradesh and Bundelkhand  
had only suggestive value but no material significance in Constitutional terms.

The power of centre in this regard can be seen from the Telangana issue. In case of creation of  
the state of Telangana, the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill, 2013 was decisively rejected by  
the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly and Council. But the same did not deter the  
Government from going ahead with the passage of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act,  
2014 (Telangana) in the Parliament.

While the legal interpretation of Article 3 is clear, i.e. the views of the Andhra Pradesh Assembly  
had no legal effect; the formation of Telangana was solely the prerogative of the Government of  
India but this position should be reconsidered in the light of the evolving meaning of Indian  
Federalism.

### 1.4. Article 4

Laws made under Articles 2 and 3 to provide for the amendment of the First and Fourth  
Schedule or containing supplemental, incidental and consequential provisions are not to be  
deemed to be an amendment of this Constitution for the purposes of the Article 368. This  
means that such laws can be passed by a simple majority and by the ordinary legislative  
process.

#### 1.4.1. Does Cession of an Indian Territory need a Constitutional Amendment?

This question came up for examination before the Supreme Court in a reference made by the  
President in 1960. The decision of the Central government to cede part of a territory known as  
**Berubari Union** (West Bengal) to Pakistan (Nehru-Noon Agreement of 1958) led to political  
agitation and controversy and thereby necessitated the Presidential reference. The Supreme  
Court held that the power of Parliament to diminish the area of a state (under Article 3) _does  
not cover cession of Indian territory_ to a foreign country. Since the implementation of the  
agreement would result in the reduction in the total area of India, Article 1 as well as relevant  
portions of the First Schedule of the Constitution would have to be amended. Hence, Indian  
territory can be ceded to a foreign state only by **amending the Constitution under Article 368**.  
Consequently, the 9th Constitutional Amendment Act (1960) was enacted to transfer the said  
territory to Pakistan.

During 2011, a protocol was signed to exchange enclaves under the Land Boundary agreement  
of 1974. The Agreement envisaged a transfer of 111 Indian enclaves to Bangladesh in return of  
51 enclaves to India. However, the same needed to be ratified by the Parliament. In accordance  
with this, the Constitutional (119th Amendment) Bill was passed in 2015. The Bill amends the  
First Schedule of the Constitution to give effect to the agreement. The Bill amends the  
paragraphs relating to the territories of Assam, West Bengal, Meghalaya, and Tripura in the First  
Schedule. On the other hand, the Supreme Court in 1969 ruled that settlement of a boundary  
dispute between India and another country does not require a constitutional amendment. It

## 2\. Evolution of States and Union Territories

Post-independence, the reorganization of the states on the basis of language became a major  
aspect of national consolidation and integration. It was a huge task to integrate the provinces,  
whose boundaries were drawn in a haphazard manner by the Britishers, along with the  
integration of princely states in post-independence period, which further added to the  
heterogeneity.

British India had two types of territories

-   Provinces, governed directly by British Officials who were responsible to the Governor-  
    General of India
-   Princely states under the control of local hereditary rulers having British government as the  
    sovereign but enjoying autonomy based on treaty.

When India gained Independence on 15th August, 1947, the British Government dissolved their  
treaty relations with the over 600 princely states, who had the option of acceding to either  
India or Pakistan. Most of the princely states joined India either voluntarily or by armed  
intervention.

Subsequently, during the period 1947 - 50, these states were politically integrated into the Indian  
Union by either merging with the existing provinces or by organising into new provinces. i.e. on  
26 th January 1950, when the new constitution came into existence, the constituent units of  
Indian Union were classified into four classes:

-   The Part A states included the erstwhile Governor’s provinces. The nine part A states were  
    Assam, Bihar, Bombay, Madhya Pradesh, Madras, Orrisa, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and West  
    Bengal.
-   The Part B states were former princely states or group of Princely states, governed by  
    Rajpramukh, who was often a former prince, along with an elected legislature. The  
    Rajpramukh was appointed by the President of India. The Part B states were Hyderabad,  
    Jammu & Kashmir, Madhya Bharat, Mysore, Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU),  
    Rajasthan, Saurashtra, Travancore-Cochin and Vindhya Pradesh
-   The Part C states included both the former chief commissioner’s provinces and some  
    princely states except Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Part C states were Ajmer, Bhopal,  
    Bilaspur, Cooch-Behar, Coorg, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Kutch, Manipur and Tripura.
-   The Part D included only Andaman and Nicobar Island and was administered by the  
    Lieutenant Governor.

## 3\. History of the Demand of Reorganisation of States

The boundaries of provinces in pre-1947 India had been drawn in a haphazard manner as the  
British conquest of India had proceeded for nearly a hundred years. No heed was paid to  
linguistic and cultural cohesion so that most of the provinces were multilingual and  
multicultural. There has been a constant demand for reorganisation of states on the linguistic  
lines. The Indian National Congress recognised this anomaly as early as 1917 and decided to  
structure its state units on linguistic basis. But after Independence, having witnessed a partition  
on the basis of religion, the demands for new states on linguistic basis were seen with  
suspicion.

In the wake of demands from all quarters for new states, a Linguistic Provinces Commission  
(also called Dhar Commission), under the Chairmanship of S.K. Dhar, was set up by the  
President of the Indian Constituent Assembly in 1948 to consider the question of reorganization  
of states in India. The Commission in its report recommended that the reorganization of states

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

should be on the basis of administrative convenience rather than on linguistic basis. Student Notes:

The Indian National Congress in its Jaipur Session set up a high level committee called **Linguistic  
Provinces Committee –** consisting of Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and Pattabhi  
Sitaramiah (JVP Committee) to consider the Dhar Commission’s recommendation. In its report,  
the committee counselled utmost caution in proceeding with the proposal for the linguistic  
reorganization of States.

However, the Government of India, in 1953 was forced to create the first linguistic state, the  
state of Andhra, by separating the 16-Telugu speaking districts of Madras state, comprising of  
the Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema Regions, following the long drawn agitation and death of  
Potti Sriramulu, after a 56 day hunger strike for the cause.

This sparked off agitations all over the Union of India, where the various linguistic and religious  
regions demanded separate statehoods. Subsequently, Jawaharlal Nehru appointed the States  
Reorganization Commission (1953), under the chairmanship of Fazl Ali to examine the whole  
question. The other two members of the Commission were KM Panikkar and HN Kunzru. In  
1955, the Commission submitted its report. While laying down that due consideration should  
be given to administrative and economic factors, it recognized for the most part the linguistic  
principle and recommended redrawing of state boundaries on that basis.

The four criteria laid down by the State Reorganisation Commission (SRC) for accepting the  
demand by a region for the formation of a state are:

-   States are to be formed on the basis of linguistic and cultural unity
-   Creation of states should strengthen and preserve national unity
-   Formation of new states should also be governed by financial, administrative and economic  
    viability
-   It should aid the process of implementation of Five Year Plans.

The State Reorganisation Act was passed by the Parliament in November 1956. It provided for  
fourteen states and six centrally administered territories. The Constitutional (Seventh)  
Amendment Act was passed to replace the four types of states, known as Part A, B, C and D  
with a single class of states.

The reorganisation of existing state boundaries since the consolidation of Indian Union in 1950  
can be broadly classified under three broad waves of reorganisation.

-   The first major reorganization occurred in 1956 following a nationwide movement for the  
    creation of linguistically compact provinces. Kashmir had already been incorporated within  
    the Indian union based on the special status granted to it by Article 370.
-   The second major initiative came in the 1970s, when the Northeast was split up and several  
    new states were created following the establishment of Nagaland in 1963.
-   The third phase marked the creation of Jharkhand, Uttaranchal and Chhattisgarh in the  
    Northern provinces of India.

Each phase of re-organisation was based on a new balance of political power between the  
Centre and its federal Units. Reorganization resulted in rationalizing the political map of India,  
without seriously weakening its unity. The Linguistic reorganization during 1950’s was a major  
development in incorporating cultural identities into political and administrative units. By  
reorganizing the states on Linguistic lines, the national leadership removed a major grievance  
which could have led to fissiparous tendencies. States reorganisation is, therefore, ‘best  
regarded as clearing the ground for national integration.’

### 3.2. Creation of Union Territories in India Student Notes:^

The Union Territories are eight in number – Delhi; Andaman & Nicobar Islands; Dadra and Nagar  
Haveli and Daman &diu; Lakshadweep; Jammu &Kashmir; Ladakh; Pondicherry and Chandigarh.

The union territories have been created for a variety of reasons:

1.  Political and administrative consideration—Delhi and Chandigarh.
2.  Cultural distinctiveness—Puducherry, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu.
3.  Strategic importance—Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep.
4.  Special treatment and care of the backward and tribal people—Mizoram, Manipur,  
    Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh which later became states.

**DADRA AND NAGAR HAVELI AND DAMAN AND DIU**

The Portuguese ruled Dadra and Nagar Haveli territory until its liberation in 1954. Subsequently,  
the administration was carried on till 1961 by an administrator chosen by the people  
themselves. It was converted into a union territory of India by the 10th Constitutional  
Amendment Act, 1961.

Goa and Daman and Diu India were also acquired from the Portuguese by means of a police  
action in 1961. They were constituted as a union territory by the 12th Constitutional  
Amendment Act, 1962. Later, in 1987, Goa was conferred a statehood. Consequently, Daman  
and Diu was made a separate union territory.

As of 26 January 2020, both the UTs – Dadra & Nagar Haveli; and Daman & Diu have been  
merged. The merged Union Territory will be named as Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and  
Diu. The merger of the two UTs, located along the western coast near Gujarat, is being done for  
better administration and to check duplication of various works.

##### JAMMU &KASHMIR; LADAKH

The two Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh came into existence on National  
Unity Day from the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir which has now officially ceased to  
exist. The UT of Jammu and Kashmir will have a legislature like Puducherry with an elected  
legislative assembly and a chief minister. Ladakh, on the other hand, will be a UT without  
legislature like Chandigarh.

The Centre will be in direct control of the police and law and order in Jammu and Kashmir but  
land and other subjects will be under the purview of the elected government there.

##### PUDUCHERRY; DELHI

The territory of Puducherry comprises the former French establishments in India known as  
Puducherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam. A treaty of cession was signed by India and France in

1956.  Until 1962, when the French Parliament ratified the agreement, it was given the status of  
    an ‘acquired territory’. It finally got the status of a Union Territory in 1962, when India and  
    France exchanged instruments of ratification under which France ceded to India full sovereignty  
    over the territories it held. Further, in 2006, the Parliament passed a Bill to rename the Union  
    Territory of Pondicherry as Puducherry in response to the wishes of the people of the Union  
    Territory.

For the Union Territory of Pondicherry, the Parliament has by enacting a law, viz. Pondicherry  
(Administration) Act, 1962 under Art. 239A made provision for a legislature etc.

By an amendment to the constitution two new articles, viz. 239AA and 239AB were inserted in  
1992 providing for a legislature and a ministry for Delhi, which has been named as National

Capital Territory of Delhi by Art. 239AA. Student Notes:

The establishment of legislatures in the union territories does not diminish the supreme control  
of the president and Parliament over them.

-   The Parliament can make laws on any subject of the three lists (including the State List) for  
    the union territories. This power of Parliament also extends to Puducherry and Delhi
-   But, the legislative assembly of Puducherry can also make laws on any subject of the State  
    List and the Concurrent List.
-   Similarly, the legislative assembly of Delhi can make laws on any subject of the State List  
    (except public order, police and land) and the Concurrent List

**Union Territories** other than Delhi, Puducherry and J&K, do not have legislatures. They are  
centrally administrated areas, to be governed by the President, acting through an  
‘Administrator’ appointed by him, and issuing Regulations for their good government \[ _Arts._ 239 -  
240\].

Should statehood be granted to Delhi?

**YES**

-   In 1991, when the 69th Amendment  
    created the Legislative Assembly of Delhi,  
    the city’s population was much smaller.  
    Today, there are nearly two crore people  
    in Delhi and nowhere in any democracy  
    are two crore people represented by a  
    government with restricted powers.
-   With time, Goa, Manipur, Himachal  
    Pradesh and Tripura have also been  
    granted statehood after some transition  
    time
-   It would also provide equal right of people  
    for representation and self-governance.
-   An elected government representing a  
    massive population need to have a say in  
    law and order and land management.

##### NO

-   The support for full statehood has not  
    been a national compulsion, but a call  
    fuelled by Delhi’s local political ambitions  
    and Delhi is the national capital and must  
    necessarily be viewed from the prism of  
    the interests of the entire country.
-   Delhi is home to vital institutions such as  
    the president’s estate, the Parliament and  
    foreign embassies which are the sole  
    responsibility of the Union Government  
    and not of any one particular state  
    legislative assembly
-   Indian government must have some  
    territory under its control; it cannot  
    possibly be an occupant or a tenant of a  
    state government.
-   India’s national capital belongs to every  
    citizen of the country and not just those  
    who reside in the city.

## 4\. Issues in Reorganisation of States

### 4.1. Demand for New States - Is it a Threat to the Unity of the

### Nation?

Ramachandra Guha argues that the creation of linguistic states has safeguarded the unity of  
India. Pakistan was divided, and Sri Lanka subject to protracted Civil War, because Bengali  
speakers in the former and Tamil speakers in the latter case were denied the autonomy and  
dignity they wanted and deserved. On the other hand, the fact that in India citizens were free  
to educate and administer themselves in their own language has created a feeling of comfort  
and security.

Eminent scholars and other many are of the view that linguistic states were necessary in the

```

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

early stages of Indian independence, but now it may be time for a further reorganisation of Student Notes:  
states. The proponents of Vidharbha and Gorkhaland also have a robust case like Telangana.  
Their regions are well defined in an ecological and cultural sense, and have historically been  
neglected by the more powerful or richer part of the states.

After 65 years of Independence, there need no longer be any fear about the unity of India. The  
country is not about to Balkanise(break up). The real problems in India today have to do with  
the quality of governance. Smaller states may be one way to address the problem.

### 4.2. Is There a Need for 2nd State Reorganisation Commission?

The increasing demand for new states raises a number of questions with regard to the well-  
being of India’s federal democratic polity. There are four measures that must be considered  
while devising any framework to address the issue of federal reorganisation.

-   The constitution of a permanent State Reorganisation Commission
-   Amendment of the Constitution to ensure that the demand for a new state emanates from  
    the state legislature and not at the centre
-   Examination of economic and social viability rather than political considerations
-   Clear-cut safeguards to encourage democratic concerns like development and governance  
    rather than religion, caste and language as valid grounds for a new state

There have long been calls for the establishment of a second States Reorganisation Commission  
(SRC) to take a more comprehensive look at the shape and size of India's states. If one were to  
be established, a new SRC might address the following range of questions.

#### 4.2.1. Does India Need More States?

India sits at the bottom of the federal league table of numbers of states per capita population.  
It has an average of over 35 million people per state. That compares to about 7 million people  
in Brazil, 6 million in the US or 4 million in Nigeria. However, in geographical terms, the size of  
its states is less startling. India's states are an average of about 110,000 square kilometres in  
size compared to almost 200,000 sq km in the US and over 300,000 sq km in Brazil. German  
Länder are much smaller, at an average of 22,000 sq km, while Swiss cantons are an average of  
only 1,588 sq km. So, in per capita terms, it lags behind other federal systems, but it is not an  
outlier in terms of geographical area.

Further creating more states may have some issues associated with it such as – power capture  
by dominant community/ caste/ tribe; increased probability of intra-regional rivalries among  
the sub-regions; possibility of increase in the inter-State water, power and boundary disputes;  
instability in government as small group of legislators could make or break a government; and  
inefficient usage of financial resources by duplication of work in different capitals as well as in  
establishment of new capitals and officials.

#### 4.2. 2. Does Small State Mean Better Governance?

Secondly, a new commission might ask whether smaller states are likely to improve governance.  
One thing that the creation of new states is likely to do is to increase the density of the states.  
New states require new capitals, administrative structures, courts and personnel to man them.  
While this idea of a "gravy train" is one of the reasons that critics sometimes rail against the  
expense and inefficiency of creating new states, an increase in the depth of the state may  
improve its capacity.

India has one of the lowest rates of public sector employment among G20 countries. Gaps in  
the public workforce undermine the ability of the Indian state to tax, deliver justice, security  
and basic goods like education and healthcare. Yet, filling vacancies depends critically on  
improving skills and higher education — new states hold no guarantees in this regard.

There is no necessary connection between reducing the size of states and improving

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

governance. Those who see a link between state size and governance often do so on the Student Notes:  
assumption that smaller states will be more geographically compact, more socially cohesive and  
thus will help to improve the efficiency of public spending.

It is also assumed that smaller states can improve accountability by reducing the distance  
between elected representatives and voters. Yet if one looks at the states that perform better in  
terms of economic growth, or in terms of poverty reduction, we do not see a clear relationship  
between state size and performance. Nor is it the case that the "newness" of a state is likely to  
give a boost in itself — the mixed experience of India's newest states, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand  
and Uttarakhand, demonstrates this.

#### 4.2. 3. Alternatives to Creation of New States

A third question for a new SRC is that if the ground for creation of new states is administrative  
efficiency then are there any other alternatives to creating new states that could address some  
of the concerns. In some cases, a better distribution of Central resources or a better devolution  
of power to Panchayati Raj Institutions at state level may give desired result rather than  
creating a new state. Here, it might be noted that states have extremely mixed records in the  
extent to which they have empowered sub-state institutions such as municipal corporations,  
autonomous regional councils or Panchayati raj institutions.

Other important issues include the administration of big cities and their relationship to state  
governments, which continue to address large rural electorates too. These questions also affect  
other metros, and we are likely to observe more demands in coming years for new  
administrative set-ups in big cities such as Mumbai or Bangalore in order to increase their  
autonomy from state governments. A future SRC could usefully consider the place of cities and  
mega-cities within new state set-ups.

#### 4.2. 4. Who Should Decide if New States are to be Created?

Fourth, a new SRC might wish to ask who should decide whether new states are created. It is an  
interesting feature of India's constitutional settlement that despite the centralised nature of  
Article 3, which effectively gives the Central government the power to make or break states, the  
real battles over state division are fought in state level arenas. A new SRC might consider  
whether a state assembly’s resolution supporting bifurcation should be made a necessary  
requirement.

#### 4.2. 5. Adjudicating the Existing Demands of Statehood

Lastly, any future SRC would need to adjudicate on other actually existing demands for  
statehood — in Gorkhaland, Vidarbha, Bodoland, Bundelkhand, Harit Pradesh and elsewhere. A  
question that any future SRC would — or should — not easily find an answer to is that of the  
"right" size of a state. There is no one-size-fits-all or abstract answer to which regions should  
become states. States can only emerge as a compromise or balance between regional political  
cultures, identities and demands for recognition, geographies and economic factors.

### 4.3. Gorkhaland Issue

There have been total shutdowns in Darjeeling and instances of frequent violence over demand  
for creation of Gorkhaland in recent times due to problems in functioning of GTA (Gorkhaland  
Territorial Administration). The leaders have accused state govt. of interference and not  
devolving enough financial resources to GTA.

**History of Demand for Gorkhaland**

Gorkhaland consists of Nepali-speaking people of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Kurseong and other  
hilly districts. The people belonging to these areas hardly have any connection with the Bengali  
community and are different in ethnicity, culture and language.

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

Following the agitation of 1986, a tripartite agreement was reached between Government of Student Notes:  
India, Government of West Bengal, and Gorkha National Liberation Front in July 1988. Under  
this, an **autonomous Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council** (DGHC) under a State Act was set up for  
“the social, economic, educational, and cultural advancement of the people residing in the Hill  
areas of Darjeeling District”. The Council covered the three hill sub-divisions of Darjeeling  
district and a few Mouzas within the Siliguri sub-division.

However, it did not fulfill the aspiration of Indian Gorkha identity. The Council was given limited  
executive powers but in the absence of legislative powers the aspirations of the people of the  
region could not be addressed. The non-inclusion of the Dooars region in the Council became a  
major reason of discontent.

Then **Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA)** was created in 2012 through a tripartite  
agreement signed by GoI, Govt. of West Bengal and Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM). It replaced  
the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council. It is a semi-autonomous administrative body. It has  
administrative, executive and financial powers but no legislative powers. GTA presently has  
three hill subdivisions Darjeeling, Kurseong and Mirik and some areas of Siliguri subdivision of  
Darjeeling district and the whole of Kalimpong district under its authority.

However, lack of legislative powers means that the people of the region have no control over  
laws to govern themselves by. Dooars again has been left out and instead a verification team  
has been set to identify “Gorkha majority” areas in the Dooars.

**Way forward**

The agitation for a separate Gorkhaland state must be brought to a swift end through a solution  
which meets the aspirations of the Nepali-speaking people without hurting the sentiments of  
the Bengali-speaking majority, which is largely against the division of the state. The possible  
steps include:

-   Gorkhaland on its own is not financially viable. Except tourism it doesn’t have much of its  
    own resources. Tea industry is also facing crisis. The functioning of GTA needs to be  
    improved and made accountable.
-   The Government at the centre as well as the state needs to be more sensitive towards  
    needs and aspirations of Gorkhas.
-   Economic development of the region. Hospitals, schools, public services must be set up and  
    existing ones need to be improved.
-   Creation of an Autonomous State of Gorkhaland within an undivided West Bengal can be  
    considered. Article 244 A provides for an autonomous state for certain tribal areas in Assam  
    with its own legislature and council of ministers. By a constitutional amendment, the  
    applicability of this article can be extended to West Bengal. Alternatively, through a  
    constitutional amendment, an Article similar to Article 244 A, can be inserted as a new  
    chapter in Part VI of the Constitution. This will enable the establishment of an Autonomous  
    State of Gorkhaland, with a legislature and council of ministers within the existing state of  
    West Bengal without bifurcating it.

At the same time agitators should also keep in mind that smaller and smaller states cannot be  
created on the basis of ever narrowing ethnic identities. Solutions need to be devised that are  
pragmatic as well as inclusive of the interests of all the inhabitants. Else, the ever increasing  
demands of new states will threaten the stability of the country by perpetuating the cycle of  
violence, counter-violence and protests.

**_Article 3 in the spirit of co-operative federalism?_**

**_Approach:_**

-   Briefly mention provisions of Article 3.
-   Explain both sides of the argument.
-   Drawing from the explanation, discuss whether Article 3 needs to be rechristened  
    and the direction of such changes.

**_Answer:_**

```
Article 3 authorizes the Parliament to create a new state, unite two or more states or
their parts, increase, decrease, alter boundaries or rename any state. A Bill to
implement such changes will originate in parliament but needs to be referred to
concerned state legislatures. However, their view is not binding. For a union territory
even reference need not be made to the concerned legislature.
Thus, Parliament can redraw the political map of India according to its will. Hence, the
territorial integrity or continued existence of any state is not guaranteed by the
Constitution implying India is an ‘indestructible union of destructible states’. The Union
government can destroy the states whereas the state governments cannot destroy the
Union. This was important for the unity of India in the context of fissiparous tendencies
post partition and even today when many regions are demanding newer states on ever
narrowing ethnic and tribal identities which is practically impossible.

Also, union has been liberal in accepting demands regarding creation of new states Student Notes:
based on linguistic, administrative and development aspirations of people. This formula
has been pretty successful in maintaining the ‘unity in diversity’.
But, it is also against the spirit of cooperative federalism which demands co-equal
distribution of power between centre and states but makes states mere appendages of
the union as they have almost no say in their own existence. It undermines the will of
the locals and is against the concepts of diversity and pluralism. It creates dissent
amongst people and alienates them from political leadership and constitutional
machinery. The resentment in Andhra region post formation of Telangana and
continued insurgency in North-East are some examples.
Hence, a relook seems plausible. Possible alternatives can be:
```

-   Parliament must follow the will of state legislature in case of special majority.
-   The changes if any should originate in the state legislature unless special  
    circumstances demand otherwise.  
    But any change in the provisions of the Article 3 can have unimagined consequences.  
    Hence, discussion with all the stakeholders should be done. Meanwhile, use of article 3  
    should be judiciously mixed with the provisions of the 5th and 6th schedules for greater  
    incorporation of local needs and aspirations while maintaining the unity of the country.  
    **_1\. The State Reorganization Commission had to operate within certain 'limiting factors'  
    while reorganizing the country on linguistic grounds. Discuss these limiting factors._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Explain the factors which created concern in linguistic reorganization in India.

**_Answer:_**

```
The language and culture of an area are undoubtedly important as they represent a
pattern of living which is common in that area. While examining the related issues the
Commission looked into minimum of internal cohesion and scope of positive
expression of the collective personality of a people in habitating a state or region.
Common language may not only promote the growth of such regional consciousness
but also cause administrative convenience. Moreover, in a democracy it is the duty of
the Government to ensure that the administration is conducted in a language which
the people can understand. But the Commission had to operate within certain 'limiting
factors' as well. The limiting factors were:
```

1.  A linguistic State with its regional language as its official language may easily  
    develop into an independent nationality. The road between an independent  
    nationality and an independent State is very narrow.
2.  India has been for several millennia a multilingual and multicultural country. There  
    are a large number of bilingual belts between different linguistic zones.
3.  Not all the language groups are so placed that they can be grouped into separate  
    states.
4.  There exist areas with a mixed population even within unilingual area.
5.  There is not a single major modern Indian language whose speakers do not employ  
    at least three contact languages and not a single speech-community which has less  
    than at least three distinct linguistic codes in its verbal repertoire.
6.  All major languages of India exist beyond their home-territory. As such speakers  
    maintain their native (home) language and also speak the dominant local language,  
    providing a clear case of grass-root bi-lingualism.

7.  Different zones might have been declared uni- or bi-lingual for administrative Student Notes:  
    convenience but basically each of them is a multilingual and multicultural complex  
    entity.
8.  Border areas of almost all the zones offer a diffusion belt, emerging out of contact  
    patterns with languages belonging to different families.  
    Because of such limitations, a considerable number of people speaking languages other  
    than the dominant language of a state remain a minority in the state. It required several  
    safeguard for the interests of these people.  
    **_2\. The State Reorganization Commission turned language from a dividing force to a  
    cementing and integrating one. Critically evaluate._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Discuss the apprehensions for organizing states on linguistic lines.
-   Analyze events after the acceptance of the SRC report and linguistic reorganization.
-   Point out failures of reorganization in terms of resolving fissiparous tendencies.

**_Answer:_**

```
The post-independence resurgence of regionalism in many parts of India baffled the
observers of Indian politics, and offered as the basis of prediction of the country’s
‘imminent balkanization’.
```

-   The national leadership decided to postpone state reorganization on linguistic line.  
    It was felt that linguistic states may foster separatism and create pressure on newly  
    independent nation. Local leaders opposed this decision.
-   Demands were raised in Madras and Bombay presidency. The death of congress  
    worker fasting for Separate Telugu state in Andhra led to unrest and violent  
    outburst. Andhra Pradesh was formed in 1952 to calm the situation. However, this  
    led to series of struggles for separate states which threatened the stability.
-   The State Reorganization Commission (SRC) was constituted to study this question  
    in detail. The passing of the State Reorganization Act in 1956 on recommendation  
    of SRC led to creation of numerous linguistic states.
-   Events after 1956 clearly showed that loyalty to a language was quite consistent  
    with, and was rather complementary to, loyalty to the nation. By reorganizing the  
    states on linguistic lines, the SRC removed a major grievance which could have led  
    to fissiparous tendencies. States reorganization is, therefore, ‘best regarded as  
    clearing the ground for national integration’.
-   Linguistic reorganization of the states has not in any manner adversely affected the  
    federal structure of the Union or weakened or paralysed the Centre as many had  
    feared.
-   States’ reorganization did not, of course, resolve all the problems relating to  
    linguistic conflicts. Disputes over boundaries between different states, linguistic  
    minorities and economic issues such as sharing of waters, and power and surplus  
    food still persist. Linguistic chauvinism also finds occasional expression.
-   There are demands for creation of separate states within linguistically organized  
    state. Creation of the Telangana suggests that language no more acts as cementing  
    force it used to be. Socio-economic factors, disparities within state and prospects of  
    development forms basis for state demands.  
    But it’s equally true that the reorganization on linguistic lines has removed language as  
    a major factor affecting cohesion of the country.

**_3\. The demands for state formation in India have changed their bases from linguistic to_** Student Notes:  
**_backwardness, ethnicity etc. Examine this transformation of the bases for state_**  
**_reorganization._**

**_Approach:_**

-   First mention how the demands of linguistic states had been met.
-   Then mention various aspirations of statehood emerging from larger states in terms  
    of administrative negligence, backwardness, self-assertiveness.
-   Examine merits and demerits from both the perspectives and conclude suitably.

**_Answer:_**

-   Just after independence, the Vishalandhra Movement had demanded a separate  
    state for Telgu speaking people from Madras Province.
-   Potti Sriramulu took fast unto death for Andha Cause. His death after 56 days of fast  
    had resulted in violent outburst which compelled the government of India to  
    declare Andhra Pradesh as a separate state in December 1952.
-   This inspired other leaders of different states to demand linguistic state of their  
    own. Government formed states reorganisation commission in 1953 to look into  
    the demands of linguistic states. The commission accepted the linguistic principles  
    for state formation which resulted in creation of 14 states and 6 Union Territories in
    
-   In North-East Region, various tribes demanded their own state on the basis of their  
    culture, which was fulfilled by Union Governments. Nagaland state was created in  
    1960, Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura in 1972 while Arunachal Pradesh and  
    Mizoram became separate states in 1986. In this way, this region had undergone  
    considerable political reorganisation.
-   In contemporary times the separate statehood demand has changed its hue  
    drastically. In late 1990's NDA coalition accepted the prolonged demands of  
    Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh, Uttaranchal \[later Uttarakhand\] which has different  
    motivations such as tribal state (Jharkhand), administrative inconvenience  
    (Uttarakhand) etc.
-   But, there are still long pending demands for state formation on the different basis  
    viz ethnicity, lack of development, administrative inconvenience etc. These separate  
    statehood demands are Gorkhaland (WB), Kamatpur state for Koch Rajbangsi  
    (Assam), Bodoland (Assam), Vidharbha (Maharashtra), Saurashtra (Gujarat),  
    fourfold division of Uttar Pradesh in the form of Harit Pradesh, Awadh Pradesh,  
    Purvanchal and Bundelkhand (UP+MP).
-   Demands of separate statehood on various grounds show that language is not the  
    sole bond that can bind people together. Now, some regions are aspiring for  
    preservation of their ethnic culture in the form of separate state and on the other  
    hand some regions are aspiring for better development after prolonged apathy and  
    backwardness.  
    **_4\. Ethnic similarities are as important as territorial boundaries in promoting the feeling  
    of common brotherhood among the citizens of a country. In context of the above  
    statement, examine the problems faced by people from North-East in other parts of  
    India. Also analyse the steps taken by the government in this regard._**

**_Approach:_**

```
Examine the various instances of name-calling e.g. Nido Tania murder case in Delhi and
Bangalore exodus to portray how lack of ethnic similarity of North-East Indians creates
a foreign feeling among the people from those of mainland and how this leads to

```
friction among them. Further one should give an account of the measures taken by Student Notes:
government and also suggest further measures.
```

**_Answer:_**

```
The mysterious death of Loitam Richard in Bangalore, the murder of Ramchanphy
Hongray in New Delhi, the suicide by Dana Sangma and other such incidents serve as
reminders of the insecure conditions under which people, particularly the young, from
the north-east of India have to live with in the metros of this country. Major problems
faced by people from north east in other parts of the country are:
```

-   Pervasive racial discrimination that people from the region face in metropolitan  
    India.
-   Despite hailing from an integral part of India, these survivors of racial abuse feel  
    compelled to overlook instances of mental, physical and verbal assault on a daily  
    basis.
-   People from North-East have to suffer jibes and verbal or non-verbal abuse due to  
    their different facial look.
-   Time and again, male students from the northeast have been compelled to  
    relocate elsewhere after the locals ganged up against them.

```
Some of the steps taken by the government
```

-   Delhi Police has announced an array of steps, including setting up of a new unit  
    and a helpline number to address any grievance faced by people from the north  
    east.
-   Ministry of Home Affairs constituted a committee in February, 2014 to look into  
    the various concerns of persons hailing from the North Eastern States who are  
    living in different parts of the country, especially the Metropolitan areas, and to  
    suggest suitable remedial measures which could be taken by the Government
-   The Government has already encouraged to include history of North-East in  
    school curriculum which can be a way to bring North-east closer to the main  
    stream.  
    **Some other possible steps**
-   Unless there is legal protection for the north easterners, their rights will always be  
    trampled by those who have no regard for their existence. An anti-racism law is an  
    important measure that the Indian government must take.
-   Racism is a social problem and it can only be solved at the societal level. This can  
    be done through awareness, campaign, educating the mainland people about the  
    unique history, culture, languages of north-east India.
-   A great initiative to end this disjuncture of knowledge would be by introducing  
    more information about the North Eastern region or the southern region, or any  
    other regions which have been ignored since years, into the curriculum of state  
    education boards and other central educational boards, especially NCERT books.
-   The responsibility of the police also lies in registering an FIR and then taking quick  
    action in cases of racial abuse.
-   Another important step could be to create sustainable employment opportunities  
    in the North Eastern Region to prevent the distress migration of the people from  
    north east.

## 1\. Introduction Student Notes:^

There are two classes of people in any modern country – **citizens and aliens**.

-   A **citizen** of a given state is a person **who enjoys full membership** of the political  
    community or the State. He/she enjoy all civil and political rights in that state.
-   An **alien** or mere resident is person who is a citizen of some other political community or  
    State. Thus, he/she **do not enjoy all the rights** which go to make full membership of the  
    State. Aliens are of **two types** :  
    o **Friendly aliens-** Those aliens which are citizens of friendly countries.  
    o **Enemy aliens-** Those aliens which are citizens of enemy countries. The enemy aliens are  
    denied some of the rights that the friendly aliens enjoy.

In this context, **the Citizens of India** have the following rights conferred to them by the  
Constitution of India, which are not available to aliens-

-   Some **Fundamental Rights** belong to citizen alone, such as-  
    o **Article 15 -** Right against discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place  
    of birth.  
    o **Article 16 -** Right to equality of opportunity in the matter of public employment.  
    o **Article 1 8(2)-** No citizen of India will accept any title from any of the foreign States**.**  
    o **Article 19 -** Right to freedom of speech and expression, assembly, association,  
    movement, residence and profession.  
    o **Article 29 -** Protection of interests of minorities  
    o **Article 30-** Right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions
-   Only citizens are **eligible for certain offices** , such as-  
    o The **President** of India  
    o The **Vice-President** of India  
    o The **Judge** of Supreme Court of India  
    o The **Judge** of High Court in the states.  
    o The **Governor** of a state.  
    o The **Attorney General** of India.  
    o The **Advocate General** of the state.
-   Only citizens hold the **right to vote in elections** to the Lok Sabha and State Legislative  
    Assemblies.
-   Only citizens have the right to become a **Member of Parliament** (MP) in the Parliament and  
    **Member of Legislative Assembly** (MLA) in the State legislatures.

However, apart from enjoying these exclusive rights, the citizens also need to **fulfill certain  
duties towards the Indian State** , as for example, paying taxes, respecting the national flag and  
national anthem, defending the country and so on.

## 2\. Constitutional Provisions

The provisions relating to the Citizenship have been dealt in **Part II** of the Constitution of India  
under **Articles 5 to 11.** However, these provisions do not contain either **any permanent or any

    immediately preceding such commencement.

### 2.2. Article 6 - Rights of citizenship of certain persons who have

### migrated to India from Pakistan

Notwithstanding anything in Article 5, a person **who has migrated to the territory of India from

grandparents were born in **undivided India** as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935.

Apart from this, he should fulfil any of the following two conditions-

-   **If he migrated before 19th July, 1948-** He should have been **ordinarily resident** in the  
    territory of India since the date of his migration, or
-   **If he migrated after 19 th July, 1948-** He should have been **registered** as a citizen of India by  
    the Government of India. However, a person shall be so registered only if he has been

    his application.

### 2.3. Article 7- Rights of citizenship of certain migrants to Pakistan

Notwithstanding anything in Articles 5 and 6, a person who migrated to Pakistan from India

    defined in the Government of India Act, 1935. But he has been ordinarily residing in any  
    country outside India.
-   He has been registered as a citizen of India **by the diplomatic or consular representative** of  
    India in the country where he is residing, whether before or after the commencement of  
    the Constitution.

### 2.5. Article 9- Persons voluntarily acquiring citizenship of a

### foreign state not to be citizens

No person shall be a citizen of India by virtue of Article 5, or be deemed to be a citizen of India  
by virtue of Article 6 or Article 8, if he **has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of any foreign**  
State.

### 2.6. Article 10- Continuance of the rights of citizenship

Every person who is or is deemed to be a citizen of India under any of the foregoing provisions  
of this Part shall, **subject to the provisions of any law that may be made by Parliament** ,  
continue to be such citizen.

### 2.7. Article 11- Parliament to regulate the right of citizenship by Student Notes:^

### law

Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this Part **shall derogate from the power of Parliament** to  
make any **provision with respect to the acquisition and termination** of citizenship and all other  
matters relating to citizenship.

Other than these provisions, the Constitution of India **does not deal with the problem of  
acquisition or loss of citizenship** subsequent to its commencement. It **empowers the  
Parliament** to enact a law to provide for such matters and any other matter relating to  
citizenship. Accordingly, the **Parliament of India enacted the Citizenship Act, 1955** , which has  
been amended many times subsequently in 1957, 1960, 1985, 1986, 1992, 2003, 2005, 2015  
and 2019.

-   He has been registered as an **Overseas Citizen of India** (OCI) for **5 years** and residing in  
    India for **ONE YEAR** before making application.

All the above categories of persons **must take an oath of allegiance** before they are registered  
as citizens of India

### 3.4. Citizenship by Naturalization (Section 6)

Citizenship of India by naturalization can be acquired **by a foreigner (not illegal migrant)** who is  
ordinarily resident in India for **TWELVE YEARS** (throughout the period of twelve months  
immediately preceding the date of application and for **ELEVEN YEARS** in the aggregate in the  
FOURTEEN YEARS preceding the twelve months) and **other qualifications** as specified in Third  
Schedule to the Act, such as-

-   He should not be subject or citizen of any country where **citizens of India are prevented**  
    **from becoming subjects or citizens** of that country by naturalization.
-   If he is a citizen of any country, he **undertakes to renounce the citizenship of that country**  
    in the event of his application for Indian citizenship being accepted.
-   He is of **good character.**
-   He has an **adequate knowledge of a language** specified in the **Eighth Schedule** to the  
    Constitution.
-   He intends to reside in India, or to enter into or continue in, service under a Government in  
    India or under an international organization of which India is a member.

The Government of India, **may waive all or any of the above conditions for naturalization,** if in  
its opinion, the person has rendered distinguished services to the cause of **science, philosophy,  
art, literature, world peace or human progress** generally. Recently, the period of residence to  
acquire citizenship under this section was reduced for some special cases under the **Citizenship  
(Amendment) Act 2019** (taken up in detail later in this chapter).

All such persons who acquire citizenship by naturalization, shall take **an oath of allegiance** to  
the Constitution of India.

### 3.5. Citizenship by Incorporation of Territory (Section 7 ) Student Notes:^

If any **foreign territory becomes a part of India** , the Government of India, may by orders  
notified in the Official Gazette, specify the persons who shall be citizens of India by reasons of  
their connection with that territory, and those persons shall be citizens of India as from the date  
to be specified in the order. E.g. when Pondicherry became a part of India, people of  
Pondicherry became the citizens of India under the **Citizenship (Pondicherry) Order, 1962** ,

#### issued under the Citizenship Act, 1955.

## 4\. Loss of Citizenship

Termination of Citizenship is covered in **Section 9 of the Citizenship Act, 1955**. It prescribes  
**three ways** in which a person may **lose his citizenship** , whether acquired under this Act or prior  
to it under the Constitution of India.

### 4.1. Renunciation of Citizenship (Section 8)

If any citizen of India of full age and capacity, who is also a citizen or national of another  
country, makes a declaration renouncing his Indian citizenship, then that person shall cease to  
be a citizen of Indian. Provided that if any such declaration is **made during any war in which  
India may be engaged** , registration thereof shall be withheld until the Government of India  
otherwise directs.

Where a person ceases to be a citizen of India, **every minor child of that person shall there  
upon cease to be a citizen of India** , provided that any such child **may, within one year after  
attaining eighteen years of age** , make a declaration that he wishes to resume Indian citizenship  
and shall thereupon again become a citizen of India.

### 4\. 2. Termination of Citizenship (Section 9)

Any citizen of India who **voluntarily acquires** , or has at any time between the 26th January  
1950 and the commencement of this Act **voluntarily acquired** , the citizenship of another  
country, cease to be a citizen of India. However, this provision does not apply **during any war**  
in which India may be engaged.

If any question arises as to whether, when or how any person has acquired the citizenship  
of another country, it shall be determined by such authority, in such manner, and having regard  
to such rules of evidence, as may be prescribed in this behalf. The acquisition of another  
country's passport is also deemed under the **Citizenship Rules, 1956** to be voluntary acquisition  
of another country’s nationality.

### 4\. 3. Deprivation of Citizenship (Section 10)

The Government of India can deprive any citizen of Indian Citizenship if it is satisfied that:

-   The citizen has obtained citizenship by means **of fraud, false representation or**  
    **concealment** of any material fact; or
-   That citizen has shown himself by act or speech to **be disloyal or disaffected** towards the  
    Constitution of India as by law established; or
-   That citizen has, during the war in which India may be **engaged, unlawfully traded or**  
    **communicated with an enemy** or been engaged in or associated with, any business that  
    was to his knowledge carried on in such manner as to assist any enemy in that war;
-   That citizen has, **within five years after registration or naturalization** , been sentenced in  
    any country to **imprisonment for a term of not less than two years** ; or
-   That citizen has been ordinarily resident out of India for a continuous period of seven years.  
    However, **this will not apply** , if he has been at any time a **student of any educational**  
    **institution in a country outside India** or in the **service of a Government of India** or of an

```
International organization of which India is a member, or has registered annually in the Student Notes:
prescribed manner at an Indian consulate his intention to retain his citizenship of India.
```

The Central Government shall not deprive a person of citizenship unless it is satisfied that it is  
not conducive to **the public good** that person should continue to be a citizen of India.

## 5\. Concept of Dual Citizenship

Citizenship is generally defined based on some common factors. One could be a citizen of a  
country for one or more of the following reasons

▪ **Right of the Soil** - if he was born in the territory (within the borders) of that country  
▪ **Right of Blood** - If one or both of his parents are citizens of that country.  
▪ **By Marriage** - If he is married to a person who is a citizen of that country (this is no longer  
an automatic process - he still needs to apply for citizenship)  
▪ **Naturalization** - If he obtained citizenship of the country by going through the legal process  
of naturalization.

As there are various ways to acquire citizenship of a country, it is possible for someone to be  
considered a **citizen under the laws of two or more countries** at the same time. This is dual  
citizenship. Dual citizens can **carry two passports** and essentially live work and travel freely  
within their native and naturalized countries. **Some countries do not allow dual citizenship**. For  
example, **South Korean and American** citizenship cannot be carried on hand in hand.

Initially, India also **did not allow** for the any rights to people of Indian origin who are residents  
of other countries now. However, the Government setup a **High-Level committee on Indian  
Diaspora** under the Chairmanship of **L.M. Singhvi** to do comprehensive study of the global  
Indian Diaspora and to recommend measures for a constructive relationship with them. Based  
on the recommendations, the Indian Parliament amended the Citizenship Act in 2002 and  
provided for two special status-

-   **Person of Indian Origin Card** (PIO) **Scheme** , for persons who, or any of their ancestors,  
    were Indian nationals and who are presently holding another country’s citizenship/  
    nationality i.e. he/she is holding foreign passport.
-   **Overseas Citizenship of India** for the above PIOs, who have migrated from India and  
    acquired citizenship of a foreign country (other than Pakistan and Bangladesh), are eligible  
    for certain benefits, “ **as long as their home countries allow dual citizenship in some form**  
    **or the other under their local laws** ”.

### 5.1. Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder

Both the schemes were running in parallel even though the OCI card scheme had become more  
popular. This was causing unnecessary confusion in the minds of applicants. Keeping in view  
some problems being faced by applicants and to provide enhanced facilities to them, the  
Government of India decided to formulate one single scheme after merging the PIO and  
schemes. Consequently, the **Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2015** , modified the provisions  
pertaining to the OCI in the Principal Act. It has introduced a new scheme called “ **Overseas  
Citizen of India Cardholder** ” by merging the PIO card scheme and the OCI card scheme.

**Benefits of Merger**

-   **Simplification** of the rules under a single umbrella.
-   PIO cardholders are now **eligible for benefits already enjoyed** by OCI cardholders.
-   Facilitate **visa-free travel** to India, rights of residency and participation in business and  
    educational activities in the country.
-   Resolve the **complains of visits by PIOs to local police stations** and stringent visa norms  
    that debarred them from buying property in India, in comparison to those holding OCI card.

-   It also does away with the **clause of foreigners** who marry Indians to continuously stay in Student Notes:^  
    the country for a period of one year before they get Indian citizenship.
-   It gives foreigners a **relief of 30 days** in a year when they can travel outside the country.

**Rights of people with Overseas Citizen of India Card**

Such people shall be entitled to such rights, as the Government of India may specify in this  
behalf. However, such persons **shall not have the following rights** as given to Citizens of India,  
which include-

-   **Right to equality** of opportunity in matters of public employment.
-   **Eligibility for election** as President of India, Vice President of India, Member of the Lok  
    Sabha, Member of Rajya Sabha, Member of State Legislative Assemblies or Councils.
-   **Eligibility for appointment** as a Supreme Court Judge, High Court Judge. He shall not be  
    eligible for appointment to public services and posts in connection with affairs of the  
    Union or of any State except for appointment in such services and posts as the Central  
    Government may specify.

**Renunciation of Overseas Citizen of India Card**

This status may be terminated for such persons, if they make in prescribed manner a  
**declaration renouncing the Card** registering them as an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder  
and such a declaration is registered by the Government of India.

When a person ceases to be an OCI Cardholder, that person’s **spouse, minor children** also cease  
to be an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder.

**Cancellation of Overseas Citizen of India Card**

The Government of India may cancel the registration of a person as an Overseas Citizen of India  
Cardholder, if it is satisfied in the following conditions-

-   He has **obtained the status by means of fraud** , false representation or the concealment of  
    any material fact; or
-   He has shown **disaffection towards the Constitution of India** ; or
-   He has, during any war in which India may be engaged, unlawfully traded or **communicated**  
    **with an enemy** ; or
-   He has, within five years after registration, been **sentenced to imprisonment** for a term of  
    not less than two years; or
-   It is necessary so to do in the **interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India** , the  
    security of India, friendly relations of India with any foreign country, or in the interests of  
    the general public; or
-   The **marriage of an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder** -  
    o has been dissolved by a competent court of law or otherwise; or  
    o has not been dissolved but, during the subsistence of such marriage, he has solemnised  
    marriage with any other person.

### 5.2. Other Steps taken towards Indian Diaspora Student Notes:^

**Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs**

The Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA), dedicated to the multitude of Indian Nationals  
settled abroad was established in May 2004 as the **Ministry of Non-Resident Indians’ Affairs** , it  
was renamed as the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA) in September 2004. Driven by a  
mission of development through coalitions in a world without borders, MOIA seeks to connect  
the Indian Diaspora community with its motherland.

Positioned as a Services’ Ministry, it provided information, partnerships and facilitations for all Student Notes:  
matters related to Overseas Indians (comprising Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) and Non-  
Resident Indians (NRIs). Besides dealing with all matters relating to Overseas Indians, the  
Ministry was engaged in several initiatives with them for the promotion of trade and  
investment, emigration, education, culture, health and science & technology.

In 2016, this ministry was **merged with Ministry of External Affairs** because majority of its  
activities were done through MEA only. It was felt that a separate ministry was not needed and  
the same can be done by a division under MEA. Hence, currently **division of Overseas Indian  
Affairs exists** performing the functions done by erstwhile ministry**.**

## 6\. Status of Refugees in India

India has **not signed** the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention on the Status of Refugees, or  
its 1967 Protocol. The lack of specific refugee legislation in India has led the government to  
adopt an **adhoc approach to different refugee influxes**. The status of refugees in India is  
governed mainly by political and administrative decisions rather than any codified model of  
conduct. The ad hoc nature of the Government’s approach has led to varying treatment of  
different refugee groups. Some groups are granted full range of benefits including legal  
residence and the ability to be legally employed, whilst others are criminalized and denied  
access to basic social resources.

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

The legal status of refugees in India is governed mainly by the **Foreigners Act 1946** and the Student Notes:  
**Citizenship Act 1955**. These Acts do not distinguish refuges and apply to all non-citizens equally.  
Under the Acts it is a criminal offence to be without valid travel or residence documents. These  
provisions render refugees liable to deportation and detention.

The head office of UNHCR's mission in India is based in New Delhi. Once recognized, Afghan,  
Burmese, Palestinian and Somali refugees receive protection from the UNHCR. Many  
refugees receive a small monthly subsistence allowance, and all have access to the services  
provided by the UNHCR’s implementing partners in Delhi, such as the YMCA, Don Boscov and  
the Socio-Legal Centre (SLIC).

The largest refugee populations in India do not fall under the UNHCR’s mandate but are  
nonetheless considered refugees by the government. There are over 1, 50,000 Tibetans and  
90,000 Sri Lankans who have fled violence and persecution and sought refuge in India. These  
groups are accommodated and assisted in accessing education, healthcare, employment and  
residence to varying degrees.

**Refugees from different countries in India**

-   **Tibetan Refugees-** Following the Chinese incursion in 1951, in 1959, many Tibetans fled to  
    India. Tibetans who arrived in India in the late 1950s and early 1960s were accorded  
    refugee status by the Indian government. These Tibetans were issued registration  
    certificates, which must be renewed once or twice a year. Tibetans who were born in India  
    are also eligible to obtain a registration certificate once they are 18 years old.
-   **Sri Lankan Refugees-** Sri Lankans who are considered to be a threat to national security are  
    deemed to be militants and detained in ‘special camps’ in Chenglepet or Vellore.  
    Nonetheless, in general the Government of India recognizes Sri Lankans fleeing violence at  
    home to be refugees and accordingly grants them protection.
-   **Bhutanese Refugees-** Since 1949, Bhutanese citizens have been permitted to move freely  
    across the Indian border. An Open border between India and Nepal and India and Bhutan is  
    provided for by a treaty between the respective states, last updated in February 2007. The  
    right to residence, study, and work are guaranteed without the need for identity papers.
-   **Hindu Pakistani Refugees-** Roughly 1,15,000 people displaced from Pakistan have arrived  
    in India since 1965. They can avail Indian citizenship as per the recent amendments made in  
    the Citizenship Act in 2019.
-   **Rohingyas-** Rohingya are people who reside in Rakhine State, Myanmar. In August 2017, the  
    Government of India had announced that it was planning to deport all 40,000 Rohingya  
    refugees living in the country. In a petition before the Supreme Court, it has been alleged  
    that Rohingya trying to enter India were being forcefully pushed back to Myanmar in  
    violation of their human rights. A bench led by the Chief Jutice of India is hearing a batch of  
    petitions filed by some rohingyas against their deportation home in the face of imminent  
    death.
-   **Chakmas and Hajongs-** Chakmas and Hajongs are ethnic people who lived in the Chittagong  
    Hill Tracts, most of which are located in Bangladesh. They had to leave their homeland  
    bordering India and Myanmar because of **Kaptai dam** project in 1960s.  
    o They allegedly faced religious persecution and entered India through Lushai Hills district  
    of Assam (now Mizoram). The Centre had moved majority of them to North Eastern  
    Frontier Agency (now Arunachal Pradesh).  
    o Now the Centre has decided to provide citizenship to Chakma (Buddhist) and Hajong  
    (Hindus) refugees as per the Supreme Court's 2015 order. However, this is being  
    opposed by the indigenous people of Arunachal. In light of these protests, the Centre  
    has decided to grant ‘limited citizenship’ to them. They will not get land rights or be  
    recognised as a Scheduled Tribe in Arunachal Pradesh so that the rights of the  
    indigenous people are not diluted

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   **Palestinian Refugees-** 160 Palestinians are currently seeking refugee status and are the Student Notes:^  
    most recent refugee group to arrive in India. The UN High Commission for Refugees  
    (UNHCR) in Delhi has recognized some of the Palestinians as refugees and other  
    applications are under consideration. These refugees have not been issued residence  
    permits by the Indian government.

## 7\. Refugee vs. Asylum Seeker

When people flee their own country and seek sanctuary in another country, they apply for  
asylum – **the right to be recognized as a refugee and receive legal protection and material  
assistance.** An asylum seeker must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution in his or her  
home country is well-founded. Hence **refugee is an asylum seeker whose application has been  
successful.**

Although India has provided shelter to one of the largest refugee populations in South Asia, it  
**lacks a uniform asylum policy**.

**In contemporary time need of a uniform asylum policy is felt due to following reasons:**

-   Due to absence of a uniform policy the government has to consider requests on case to  
    case basis which is **lengthy and time consuming process**.
-   India seeks to have a seat in permanent seat in UNSC and membership of groups like NSG;  
    For a **global leader it is necessary to have a refugee policy** in place which will enhance its  
    good will.
-   By having an asylum policy India will be in a better situation to **deal with issues like**  
    **Baluchistan** as it would get support from those leaders who fight for Humanitarian cause.  
    This will also help in dealing with Pakistan strategically.
-   Although existing provisions might serve the need of asylum seeker but compiling them into  
    a uniform law will project a **positive picture of the country before international arena**.
-   Since India is one of the **largest contributor of troops in UN Peace keeping mission** , having  
    a policy for asylum will complement these efforts.

**However, same time adoption of a uniform asylum policy can create some challenges like:**

-   Borders in South Asia are extremely porous and any conflict can result in a **mass movement**  
    **of people** leading to a strain on local infrastructure and resources and also upsetting the  
    demographic balance
-   It will be **bound by law not to repatriate a single refugee against their will** which is  
    sometime necessary to deal with political crisis
-   Giving shelter to every refugee may **create new problems like human trafficking and drug**  
    **trafficking and abuse**. It will put additional financial and administrative burden on the  
    State.

India has already faced a surge of refugees and it has dealt the matter well to the large extent  
possible without any formal policy. The recently enacted Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 is a  
step towards making well framed asylum policy but it is still narrow. In this context a lot needs  
to be done to wider its ambit so that it can cover all asylum related cases comprehensively.

## 8\. Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019

Recently, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019 was enacted by the Parliament that seeks  
to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955.

**Background**

-   **Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003** provided that ‘illegal migrants’ will not be eligible to  
    apply for citizenship by either registration or naturalisation.
-   **Section 2(1)(b)** of Citizenship Act, 1955 defines illegal migrant as a foreigner who:

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
o enters the country without valid travel documents, like a passport and visa or Student Notes:
o enters with valid documents but stays beyond the permitted time period.
```

-   However, considering the plight of minorities in these countries, some concessions have  
    been given in recent times, such as:  
    o **Foreigners Act, 1946** (regulates the entry and departure of foreigners in India) and the  
    Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 (mandates foreigners to carry passport) empower  
    the central government to imprison or deport illegal migrants.  
    o In 2015 and 2016, two notifications were issued by Central government exempting  
    certain groups of illegal migrants from provisions of the 1946 and the 1920 Acts. These  
    groups are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan,  
    Bangladesh and Pakistan, who arrived in India on or before December 31, 2014.  
    o This implies that these groups of illegal migrants will not be deported or imprisoned for  
    being in India without valid documents.

**Arguments in favour of the Amendment Act**

-   **Religious persecution** - Nehru-Liaquat pact, also known as the Delhi Pact, signed in 1950,  
    sought to provide certain safeguards and rights to religious minorities like unrecognition of  
    forced conversions and returning of abducted women and looted property etc.  
    o However, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh have a state religion with  
    discriminatory blasphemy laws, religious violence and forced conversions which has  
    resulted in religious persecution of minority groups.  
    o For instance, in 1951, the Non-Muslim minorities population 23.20% in Bangladesh  
    which is around 9.6% in 2011.
-   **Illegal immigration** from neighboring countries has been a contentious issue for decades.  
    o E.g. During the 6- year long agitation that started in 1979 in Assam, the protestors  
    demanded the identification and deportation of all illegal foreigners – predominantly  
    Bangladeshi immigrants.  
    o This act would differentiate between illegal immigrants and persecuted communities  
    seeking refuge.

Student Notes:
```

**Arguments against the Amendment Act**

-   **Classification of countries** : It is not clear why migrants from these countries are  
    differentiated from migrants from other neighboring countries such as Sri Lanka (Buddhism  
    is the state religion) and Myanmar (primacy to Buddhism).  
    o Sri Lanka has had a history of persecution of a linguistic minority in the country, the  
    Tamil Eelams.  
    o Myanmar has had a history of persecution of a religious minority, the Rohingya  
    Muslims.

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   **Classification of minority communities** : The amendment simply mentions the 6 ‘minority Student Notes:^  
    communities’ and there is no mention of ‘persecuted minorities’ or ‘religious persecution.’  
    So, ideally it should not differentiate between religious persecution and political  
    persecution. Moreover, exclusion of Muslims, Jews and Atheists from CAA is said to be  
    violation of Article 14 of the constitution. For example:  
    o **Persecution of co-religionists** like Shias, Hazaras or Ahmadiyya Muslims in Pakistan  
    (who are considered non-Muslims in that country).  
    o The murder of atheists in Bangladesh has also been noticed.
-   **Classification based on date of entry** : CAA also offers differential treatment to migrants  
    based on their date of entry into India, i.e., whether they entered India before or after  
    December 31, 2014.
-   **Against the letter and spirit of Assam Accord:** The Assam accord put the date of detection  
    and deportation of foreigners as March 25 1971, whereas, for other states, it was 1951.  
    o CAA **extends the cut-off date for NRC** from 25th March 1971 to 31st Dec 2014. CAA  
    extends the cut-off date for NRC from 25th March 1971 to 31st Dec 2014.
-   **Cancellation of OCI registration:** giving the central government the power to prescribe the  
    list of laws whose violation result in cancellation of OCI registration, may amount to an  
    excessive delegation of powers by the legislature.
-   **Implication on external relations** : The amendment implies that religious persecution of  
    the Hindu minority in Bangladesh as one of the reasons for the amendment and also  
    implies that Muslim migrants from Bangladesh will be “thrown out”.  
    o This invites trouble from Bangladesh with bearing on bilateral issues. India’s strong  
    commitment to civic nationalism and religious pluralism, have been important pillars  
    on which India’s strategic partnerships with the US and the West have been built,  
    which may be imperiled.

**Way Forward**

Indian democracy is based on the concept of welfare and secular state and a progressive  
constitution where Article 21 provides the Right of a dignified life. So, it becomes a moral  
obligation of the state to allay the fears of minority communities, if any. Hence, the  
classification done in CAA on the basis of country of origin and religious minorities can be made  
more inclusive.

## 9\. National Register of Citizens

-   It is a list of Indian citizens to **decide bona fide Indian citizens** and those who fail to enlist in  
    the register will be deemed illegal migrants.
-   **National Register of Citizens, 1951** was prepared after the conduct of the Census of 1951 in  
    respect of each village, showing the houses or holdings in a serial order and indicating  
    against each house or holding the number and names of persons staying therein. These  
    registers covered each and every person enumerated during the Census of 1951.
-   **NRC Vs Census** : The census is conducted every decade, on a national level and gives the  
    state a window into the size and nature of Indian population. But the NRC is a unique  
    exercise for the **onus to prove citizenship lies with the citizens**. They have to, through a  
    documentary evidence, show how they have come to be citizens of India.

### 9.1. NRC Updation in Assam

Student Notes:

**Background**

The NRC has its roots in the **Memorandum of Settlement, or the Assam Accord** signed  
between the Assam State Students Union and the Government of India in 1985. The accord was  
an outcome of the violent anti-migrant movement of the 1980s and contained various clauses  
to curb illegal migration.

-   It contained a provision that all ‘foreigners’ who came to Assam after March 25, 1971  
    **should be detected and deported** under the Illegal Migration Determination (by Tribunals)  
    (IMDT) Act, 1983.

-   It also talked about the **deletion of foreigners' names from the electoral rolls.** Student Notes:^

The **Citizenship Act of 1955 was amended after the Assam Accord** for all Indian-origin people  
who came from Bangladesh before January 1, 1966 to be deemed as citizens. Those who came  
between **January 1, 1966 and March 25, 1971** were eligible for citizenship after registering and  
living in the State for 10 years while those entering after March 25, 1971, were to be deported.  
However, nothing much happened over the decades.

In 2014, the **Supreme Court asked the state government to update the 1951 NRC** in a time-  
bound manner. The exercise was conducted under the supervision of the Supreme Court.

**NRC updation** is the process of enlisting the names of those persons (or their descendants)  
whose names appear in either of the following-

-   any of the Assam’s Electoral Rolls within up to 24th March 1971, or
-   1951 NRC, or
-   any of the admissible documents stipulated such as land or tenancy record, citizenship  
    certificate or permanent residential certificate etc.

In August, 2019, the updated and final National Register of Citizens, which validates bonafide  
Indian citizens of Assam has was released with over **19 lakh applicants** having failed to make it  
to the list.

**Significance of having an NRC**

-   **A long-term solution** : Established measures to curb illegal migration from Bangladesh, such  
    as diplomatic and border management efforts failed to bring any results. The two main  
    reasons for this are:  
    o Bangladesh does not recognise any infiltration taking place from its territory to India;  
    o The porous border between India and Bangladesh hinders effective border  
    management. Thus, an NRC is being viewed as an alternate and a far-sighted  
    administrative solution to the menace.
-   **A deterring tool** : It is expected to deter future migrants from Bangladesh from entering  
    Assam illegally as publication of the draft itself had created a perception that staying in  
    Assam without valid documentation will attract detention/jail term and deportation.

**Provisions for people having missed out the NRC list**

-   The Assam government assured people that those who find their names missing from the  
    final NRC **will not immediately be termed "foreigners** " or illegal immigrants.
-   Such people will be allowed to register protests with the **Foreigners Tribunal**. They can even  
    approach the High Court or even the Supreme Court for further appeal in the matter.
-   The State government will also provide **legal aid to the poor** who find their names missing.

Supreme Court held that a **Foreigners’ Tribunal's order** declaring a person as an illegal foreigner  
would be binding and would prevail over the government decision to exclude or include the  
name from the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. Foreigners’ Tribunals (FTs) are  
**quasi-judicial bodies** meant to determine whether a person is or is not a foreigner under  
Foreigner’s Act, 1946.

-   FTs were first setup in 1964 and are unique to Assam. In rest of the country, a foreigner  
    apprehended by the police for staying illegally is prosecuted in a local court and later  
    deported/put in detention centres.
-   Each FT is headed by a member who can be a retired judicial officer, bureaucrat or lawyer  
    with minimum seven years of legal practice.

**Challenges**

-   Government has brought **Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019** which seeks to grant  
    citizenship to Hindu Bangladeshis, who have entered Assam illegally post-1971. But once  
    NRC exercise will be completed, a lot of Hindu Bangladeshi might not appear in the list,  
    thus, **will be designated as illegal migrants**. Thus, it will lead to confusion and moreover  
    harden the resolve of people not to assimilate Hindu Bangladeshi in Assam according to  
    NRC.
-   It could lead to **exclusion and inclusion errors** and large number of legitimate Indian  
    citizens could end up being denied their rights.
-   Assam has experienced **communal tension** in recent times. Exclusion of some people might  
    raise apprehensions of exclusion of a particular community creating new fault lines leading  
    to social unrest.
-   Illegal migrants out of NRC will be sent back to Bangladesh, however, India does not have  
    any **deportation treaty with Bangladesh**.
-   There are apprehensions, that India will end up **creating the newest cohort of stateless**  
    **people** , raising the spectre of a homegrown crisis that will echo that of the Rohingya people  
    who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh.

**Way Forward** Student Notes:

-   **Regarding finally excluded individuals** : They would officially be non-citizens but India has  
    no fixed policy for “stateless” persons. They will surely not have voting rights but certain  
    facilities on “humanitarian grounds” may be provided to them such as right to work etc.
-   **Tackle issue of illegal migration comprehensively** : Solving illegal migrants’ issue in Assam  
    will not solve the whole issue as they may very well come through states like West Bengal  
    and then move on to the other parts of the country. Thus, following steps should be taken:  
    o **Comprehensive border management** : including fencing, total surveillance 24x7, use of  
    new imaging technology etc.  
    o **Forging bilateral agreement** with neighbouring countries that provide for taking back  
    nationals who stay illegally in the other country after due verification.  
    o **Assistance from international organisations** : such as United Nations High  
    Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organization for Migration  
    (IOM), and other concerned international agencies with experience in this kind of  
    complex issue.  
    o **Establish a SAARC convention** : India should take the initiative to encourage other  
    countries in the SAARC region to develop a SAARC convention or declaration on  
    refugees in which member states would agree to ratify the 1951 Refugee Convention.

### 9.2. Nationwide NRC

The Government of India in 2019 also signaled its intent of carrying out a nationwide NRC.

**Link between CAA and NRC/NRIC**

According to Section 14A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (inserted by Citizenship (Amendment)  
Act, 2003):

-   The Central Government **may compulsorily register every citizen of India** and issue  
    national identity card to him.
-   The Central Government may maintain a **National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC)** and for  
    that purpose establish a **National Registration Authority**.  
    o **Registrar General, India** , appointed under Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969  
    shall act as the National Registration Authority and he shall function as the Registrar  
    General of Citizen Registration.
-   To implement CAA, citizens and illegal migrants have to be identified. So, a National  
    Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC) is the necessary first step.

```
Link between NRC and NPR
```

-   The National Population Register (NPR) is a list of “usual residents of the country”. A “usual  
    resident of the country” is one who has been residing in a local area for at least the last six  
    months or intends to stay in a particular location for the next six months. So, NPR may  
    have foreigners as well.
-   However, after a list of residents is created, if a nationwide NRC is needed, it could be done  
    by verifying the citizens from that list. So, a NRC, if undertaken, would flow out of NPR.

Student Notes:
```

**Issues with nationwide National Register of Citizens**

-   **Existence of deportation provisions-** as immigrants are subject to laws like the Foreigners  
    Act, 1946 and Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and tribunals are already empowered to  
    detect, detain and deport them.
-   **Legal infirmities-** The last time the Central government tried to make an identity enrolment  
    mandatory was the Aadhaar project and this was struck down as excessive (except in  
    limited and justifiable cases). The NRIC scheme, as proposed, would thus be directly in  
    violation of the K.S. Puttaswamy judgment on **right to privacy.**
-   **Not learning from Assam’s experience-** considering the complications that have cropped  
    up in the previous NRC such as-  
    o **No clarity over previous results-** on what the end results mean for the 19 lakh plus  
    people who find them outside the NRC, potentially stateless and at risk of  
    “deportation” to Bangladesh, which refuses to acknowledge the same.  
    o **Wastage of public resources-** as many critics are questioning the expenditure of the  
    taxpayers’ money which were spent on the previous NRC.  
    o **Lack of capacity-** Assam’s first detention centre is being constructed, but it will only  
    house 3,000 people against the need for 19 lakh people excluded from the final NRC.  
    Further, media reports have been stating that these detention camps are infamous for  
    their inhumane living conditions.

```
o Protests- Many sections of Assam, like Bodoland students, have been protesting against Student Notes:
the repetition of NRC in Assam.
```

-   **Concerns of minorities** : There are fears that such an exercise could end up targeting  
    minorities in the country.  
    o **The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 20 19** which makes Hindu illegal migrants and those  
    from certain other minority communities in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan  
    eligible for Indian citizenship further creates apprehensions about alienation of  
    minorities in the process.
-   **Implementation anomalies-** as the NRC will take a gigantic toll on people’s **time, money**  
    and **productivity** , especially of the **poor and illiterate** sections.  
    o Under the Foreigners Act of 1946, the burden of proving whether an individual is a  
    citizen or not, lies upon the individual applicant and not on the state. Also, the details of  
    how such an exercise will be carried out are **not yet known**.  
    o Further, there is **poor documentary culture** in India and here around 125 crore Indians  
    will have to produce documentary proof of their ancestors up to a certain date to create  
    a legacy tree.
-   **No specific policy in ascertaining the fate of people:** The government has not prepared a  
    post NRC implementation plan, as the possibility of deportation of illegal migrants to  
    Bangladesh is bleak as the people excluded from the list should be proven citizens of  
    Bangladesh, and that will require cooperation from that country.
-   **Allegations of human rights violations-** as at a US Congress hearing on human rights in  
    South Asia, not just Kashmir issue was raised but Assam’s NRC also came up.

**Way Forward**

-   **Set a common Cut-off date to maximum two generations** - which will ease up the process  
    for citizens to show documentary proofs.  
    o The problem in Assam was the cut-off year of 1971, which made it near impossible for  
    many to get documents that went so far back in the past.  
    o The NRC should attempt to prevent further arrivals of illegal migrants. Past arrivals  
    cannot easily be wished away without causing needless human misery and also  
    disrupting micro-economies in the states where the illegals reside and work.
-   **Synchronize NRC with Census 2021** - as much as possible, as the Census 2021 will kick off  
    from September 2020, there is enough time to tell people to get their documents ready and  
    hand them over for verification to census workers, who can then remit them to the  
    designated tribunals or benches that look into the validity of the documents.
-   **Bring a fair process** - There were allegations that some sections had submitted false  
    documents during Assam’s NRC exercise. A nationwide NRC is expected to learn from this.
-   **Tackle issue of illegal migration comprehensively** - by focussing on comprehensive border  
    management, assistance from international organisations such as United Nations High  
    Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) among others.  
    o Government of India can work with other governments to get authenticated copies of  
    their own voter and citizenship records. This can be done under a large SAARC  
    convention too.
-   **Maximize use of technology** - such as utilization of digital lockers. Citizens should be told  
    get all their documents authenticated in digital lockers, so all they would need to do is  
    provide access to this documentation when the NRC happens.  
    o By appropriately using artificial intelligence and data analytics, governments can match  
    residents suspected of being immigrants fairly easily using multiple databases.

## 10\. National Population Register (NPR) vs Aadhaar Student Notes:^

The National Population Register (NPR) was a project that aimed to create a **comprehensive  
identity database of every usual resident** in the country. The database was to contain  
demographic as well as biometric particulars. It was being prepared at the local (Village/sub-  
Town), sub-District, District, State and National level.

It was launched during **2009 - 2010**. The idea was to freeze the population register after giving  
people three chances to enroll. Anyone who came to get enrolled later would have to explain  
the delay. It was hoped that this would make it difficult for fresh immigrants to get into the  
register.

There was a simultaneous launch of **AADHAAR Project in 2009** under which **UIDAI** was  
established by the government with a mandate to issue a unique 12-digit number to all  
residents of India and maintain the **UID number database**. The programme is aimed at ensuring  
inclusive growth by providing a form of identity to those who do not have any. The idea is to  
harness technological solutions and cooperative participation with the private sector to lead to  
a larger social good of providing sharper and focused assistance to those yet to get on the  
bandwagon of growth.

**Background**  
A group of ministers created after the Kargil war recommended **compulsory registration of all  
residents in India** , to facilitate the preparation of a national register of citizens and curb illegal  
migration. It had said that all Indian citizens should be given a **multi-purpose national identity  
card (MPNIC)** and non-citizens should be issued identity cards of a different colour and design.

In 2010 Registrar General of India collected data for a National Population Registry during  
Census 2011 enumeration. In 2015, this data was further updated by conducting a door-to-door  
survey. However, the government picked out **Aadhaar** as the key vehicle for transfer of  
government benefits in 2016, while putting NPR on hold due to slow progress of NPR.

Through recent notification in August 2019 by the Registrar General of India, the idea has now  
been revived and exercise of updating the 2015 NPR with additional data has begun and was to  
be completed in 2020.

Student Notes:

**Benefit of NPR**

-   **Database of residents** : It will help to create a comprehensive identity database of its  
    residents with relevant demographic details and also streamline data of residents across  
    various platforms.
-   **Better implementation** : It will help the government formulate its policies better and also  
    aid national security.  
    o Not only will it help target government beneficiaries in a better way, but also further  
    **cut down paperwork and red tape** in a similar manner that Aadhaar has done.  
    o Ministry of Home Affairs has argued that the NPR would be more suited for distributing  
    subsidies than the UID, as the NPR has data linking each individual to a household.
-   **Remove any errors** : For e.g. It is common to find different date of birth of a person on  
    different government documents. NPR will help eliminate that.
-   **Avoid duplication** : With NPR data, residents will not have to furnish various proofs of age,  
    address and other details in official work. It would also eliminate duplication in voter lists,  
    government insists.

There are **genuine divergences** in the objectives of NPR and UIDAI.

Their worldviews are from different eras. While one is rooted in a mindset of exclusion and  
security, the other is inclusive and participative.

NPR has always been an Student Notes:  
exercise in achieving and  
establishing greater control  
over people.

Aadhaar is an exercise in  
de-bureaucratisation to  
empower every single  
Indian to delink himself  
from the rent-seeking  
bureaucracy that was  
siphoning off his benefits in  
collusion with contractors  
and politicians.

The progress of the two  
overlapping identity  
databases was stymied by a  
tug of war between the  
home ministry and the  
UIDAI, after both tried to  
independently procure  
biometric data. Led by  
founder chairman Nandan Nilekani, UIDAI hit the ground running – leaving the bureaucracy-  
driven NPR far behind. NPR was also slow because it enrolled people in accordance with  
households, not just individuals.

**How is it different from Census and NRC?**

-   The exercise is **different from the decennial Census** and is **not linked to the National**  
    **Register of Citizens (NRC).**
-   **Census** doesn’t ask for individual identity details, and at the end of the day, is a macro  
    exercise. The NPR, on the other hand, is designed to collect identity details of every  
    individual.  
    o Census data is protected by a **confidentiality clause.** The government has committed  
    that it will not reveal information received from an individual for the headcount. NPR  
    would serve as the mother database to verify citizenship if a nationwide NRC is carried  
    out later.
-   Unlike the NRC, the NPR is not a citizenship enumeration drive, as it would record even a  
    foreigner staying in a locality for more than six months.  
    **Issues regarding NPR**
-   **Privacy issue** : Even as issues of privacy associated with Aadhaar continue to be debated in  
    the country, the NPR is on a drive to collect detailed data on residents of India. There is as  
    yet no clarity on the mechanism for protection of this vast amount of data.  
    o In the past, reports have stated that Aadhaar data has been compromised on multiple  
    occasions even as the UIDAI continues to deny that there have been breaches.
-   **Legality of sharing data** : Both the legality of the UID and NPR collecting data and biometrics  
    has been questioned. For example, it has been pointed out that the collection of biometric  
    information through the NPR, is beyond the scope of subordinate legislation.
-   **National security** : It can raise national security threats, given the size of the databases that  
    will be created, the centralized nature of the databases, the sensitive nature of the  
    information held in the databases, and the involvement of international agencies.
-   **Issues similar to NRC:** NPR will be the base for a nationwide National Register of Citizens  
    and will be similar to the list of citizens of Assam. During the NRC exercise, there were

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
several instances where some members of a family featured in the draft list while the Student Notes:
others did not.
```

-   **Duplication of projects** : It is unclear why the government would feel the need to subject  
    India’s citizenry to another identification drive when over 90 per cent of them are covered  
    by Aadhaar, which was an elaborate, time-consuming exercise.  
    o With these multiple projects like Aadhar, NRC, NPR, census etc it has created confusion  
    regarding the idea of citizenship in the country.
-   **Uncounted people** : The census does not cover the entire population, which leaves  
    unanswered the questions of the status of those citizens who are not visited by a census  
    officer.  
    o It also leaves ambiguity over migrant labour, who may well be citizens but would not  
    qualify as “usual residents”.

The Centre has made it clear that the home ministry-run population register should not expect  
the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to give it the biometric data of millions of  
people, collected for the purpose of obtaining the 12-digit Aadhaar number. As of now, NPR’s  
funding has been stopped by the government and is as good as dead.

**Way Forward**

There needs to clarity over the privacy concerns surrounding the amount of data being  
collected in NPR and it also needs to learn lesson from such similar exercise in Assam i.e. NRC.  
Then only it will be able to serve as the mother database to verify citizenship if a nationwide  
NRC is carried out later

## 11\. The Idea of Citizenship – An Analysis

A paradigm shift has taken place in the understanding of citizenship in India. For about 40 years,  
citizenship in India had a **philosophical and ideological basis**. Everyone born in the territory of  
India after Independence had the right to become a citizen. The **basis for granting this right  
was associational** : the founders of the Constitution wanted to adopt a concept of citizenship  
that was large enough to accommodate everyone (without any distinction) who was born on  
Indian territory. Indeed, citizenship in many republican countries is guaranteed to persons  
merely on the grounds of having been born within their territories after independence.

Apart from this, those who claimed Indian citizenship could do so by virtue of either of their  
parents having been born in the territory of India or their having been ordinarily a resident in  
the territory of India for not less than five years immediately preceding the adoption of the  
Constitution in 1950.

However, India began gradually to shift its commitment to this ideal meaning of citizenship.  
While the Citizenship Act of 1955 laid down that every person born in India on or after January  
26, 1950, was to be a citizen of India by birth, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1986, provided  
that every person born in India would be a citizen of India only if either of his/her parents was a  
citizen of India at the time of his/her birth, prioritising, thereby, Indian parentage.

The recent amendments have further broadened the scope of citizenship as well as drawn  
some sharp criticisms regarding the same philosophical and ideological basis which served as  
the benchmark of citizenship at the time of independence.

## 14\. Vision IAS GS Mains Test Series Questions

**_1\. Critically examine the provisions of the recently introduced Citizenship Amendment_**  
**_Bill 2016. Are some provisions of the bill against India's secular principles?_**

**_Approach:_**

-   Enumerate the latest amendments briefly.
-   Highlight the merits and demerit of the amendments.
-   In light of the changes introduced, discuss whether those are good or bad for  
    India’s secular fabric.

**_Answer:_**

-   India has always provided refuge to displaced communities, such as that during the  
    Bangladesh war in 1971. Refugees and problem of immigrants is becoming a global  
    pressing concern, be it the Rohingya Muslims in south east Asia or people escaping  
    war torn Syria and the Middle eastern countries.
-   The Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2016 proposes to make minority communities  
    such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan,  
    Bangladesh and Pakistan eligible for applying for Indian citizenship. Under the  
    provision for citizenship by naturalization, the bill relaxes the minimum stay  
    requirement from 11 years to 6 years.
-   **Merits:**  
    o The new amendments especially with respect to the changes made toward  
    naturalization will benefit communities such as Chakmas and Hajongs of  
    Bangladesh  
    o The provisions favour the implementation of the 1985 Assam Accord, which  
    stipulates 1971 as the cutoff date for detection and deportation of foreigners.  
    o It will also ensure India gives more impetus to its policy on refugees which  
    recognizes and protects the rights of refugees;
-   **Demerits:**  
    o However, citizenship provisions should not be granted on the basis of religion  
    as it inhibits the secular principles with which our Constitution was established.  
    o It must be noted that the provisions must be extended to Ahmadiyas in  
    Pakistan and Rohingyas from Myanmar, the Malaiha Tamils etc and other  
    persecuted minorities so as to make the provisions more holistic and in  
    concurrence with provisions under Article 14 and 21

o Also, Assam may face the additional burden of Bengali Hindus while it is already Student Notes:
overpopulated and affected by illegal migration from Bangaldesh.
```

-   To conclude, the provisions if implemented well will boost India’s reputation of  
    extending a helping hand toward international peace and security by adhering to  
    Article 51 of the DPSP and providing refuge to migrants from neighboring countries.  
    However, a proper policy should be in place so as to avoid security, law and order  
    issues as has been seen in the light of unwarranted cases of EU migrants and  
    refugees especially in context of Paris attacks last year.  
    **_2\. “The recent plight of Hindu and Sikh refugees from Pakistan and the Rohingya  
    Muslims from Myanmar again highlight the need to enact a specific refugee law in  
    India.” What are the provisions in Indian law, which currently deal with refugees?  
    Also discuss._**

**_Answer:_**

-   It is a common failure to obscure the distinction between refugees — those forced  
    to flee their countries and unable to return for fear of persecution — and migrants,  
    who leave in the hope of a better life.
-   Refugees are victims of challenging social circumstances such as civil war, violence  
    and discrimination over which they have no control, and the importance of a  
    uniform and humanitarian policy towards them cannot be overstated.
-   Despite India being a signatory to a slew of international conventions on human  
    rights, some of which implicitly endorse the principle of non-refoulement — does  
    not have a specific statute dealing with refugees.
-   As a result, refugees are covered by the omnibus Foreigners Act 1946, an archaic  
    piece of legislation that governs the stay and exit of non-nationals as a  
    homogenous category.
-   A 2004 amendment introduced by the erstwhile National Democratic Alliance  
    government prescribes stiff imprisonment for any foreigner who enters without  
    valid papers or who overstays his or her visa.
-   In the absence of enlightened, rational policy, ad hocism prevails. Some classes of  
    refugees — for example, Tibetans and Sri Lankan Tamils — have historically fared  
    better than others. Security considerations, heightened by the presence of  
    extremist groups in some neighbouring countries, are often cited to argue against  
    the desirability of a refugee law. But this is something of a red herring.
-   All laws relating to refugees involve a thorough scrutiny of the evidence provided  
    by the asylum seeker, with additional corroborative safeguards, as a part of the  
    determination process. But since there is no refugee law in India, there is no  
    process and no clear standards for the lakhs of de facto refugees whose presence  
    the Indian state tolerates but whose status it will not formalise.
-   Given its pre-eminence in South Asia, and the fact that it shelters a large refugee  
    population, India should show the way by acceding to the 1951 Refugee  
    Convention and enacting a refugee law that is humanitarian, equitable and  
    consistent with its international obligations.  
    **_3\. Citizenship is the right to have rights._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Discuss the concept of citizenship.

**_Answer:_** Student Notes:

```
The most basic, prevalent meaning of Citizenship is a certain sort of membership in a
political community. While the nature and scope of political communities have ranged
from city-state to empire, citizenship has always been associated with political
relations. In the current era, sovereign states decide who would be their citizens based
on certain parameters such as birth, naturalization, residence etc.
Most common characteristics of citizenship include equal legal status, political voice
and participation, the freedom to enter and exit one's home country and notions of
identity, belonging and a sense of home for every citizen. States’ domestic laws decide
on the associated rights and obligations of their citizens. For example, right to equality
in public employment (Article 16) and right to freedom of expression (Article 19) in
India are enjoyed only by the citizens of India. Similarly, Article 51A lists the duties of a
citizen towards the state. In this context, it has been said that citizenship brings an
inherent right to have rights. Rights and obligations exist to ensure effective
functioning of the state and welfare of its citizens.
On the other hand, a denial of citizenship deprives a person’s right to demand other
rights necessary for meaningful life. For e.g. refugees in a country as observed in case of
Rohingyas. Since they have become stateless, there is no state protection for their
other rights. Loss of citizenship also rules out hopes of any future emancipation of
these people.
```

```
But, there are certain rights which all persons are entitled to by virtue of being human
i.e. human rights. These rights transcend a person’s citizenship in a territory. For
example, right to life under Article 21 extends even to non-citizens. Thus, there are
natural rights which do not depend on affiliation of a state.
Also, globalization is changing the long standing idea that citizenship’s necessary
context is the sovereign territorial state. The state’s right to determine who is accepted
as a member is being questioned. Such debates contest that citizenship can be
exercised in a multiplicity of ‘sites’ both below (regional levels) and above
(cosmopolitan) the nation-state. Notwithstanding the evolving concept of citizenship,
inability of stateless people to enjoy their rights is well established. Further, it is for the
protection of rights of all people - whether stateless or migrants – that the citizenship
debate continues.

**_4\. How is an asylum seeker different from a refugee? Discuss the need for a uniform_**  
**_asylum policy in India._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Explain difference between asylum seeker and refugee with examples.
-   Discuss why India should have uniform asylum policy and related challenges.

**_Answer:_**

```
According to United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHCR), a refugee is someone who
has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war, or violence. A
refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality,
political opinion or membership in a particular social group. War and ethnic, tribal and
religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their countries.
When people flee their own country and seek sanctuary in another country, they apply
for asylum – the right to be recognized as a refugee and receive legal protection and
material assistance. An asylum seeker must demonstrate that his or her fear of

```
persecution in his or her home country is well-founded. Hence refugee is an asylum Student Notes:
seeker whose application has been successful.
```

```
Although India has provided shelter to one of the largest refugee populations in South
Asia, it lacks a uniform asylum policy. India has not signed the 1951 United Nations
Refugee Convention on the Status of Refugees, or its 1967 Protocol. In contemporary
time need of a uniform asylum policy is felt due to following reasons:
```

-   Due to absence of a uniform policy the government has to consider requests on  
    case to case basis which is lengthy and time consuming process.
-   India seeks to have a seat in permanent seat in UNSC and membership of groups  
    like NSG; For a global leader it is necessary to have a refugee policy in place which  
    will enhance its good will.
-   By having an asylum policy India will be in a better situation to deal with issues like  
    Baluchistan as it would get support from those leaders who fight for Humanitarian  
    cause. This will also help in dealing with Pakistan strategically.
-   Although existing provisions might serve the need of asylum seeker but compiling  
    them into a uniform law will project a positive picture of the country before  
    international arena.
-   Since India is one of the largest contributor of troops in UN Peace keeping mission,  
    having a policy for asylum will complement these efforts.  
    However, same time adoption of a uniform asylum policy can create some challenges  
    like:
-   Borders in South Asia are extremely porous and any conflict can result in a mass  
    movement of people leading to a strain on local infrastructure and resources and  
    also upsetting the demographic balance
-   It will be bound by law not to repatriate a single refugee against their will which is  
    sometime necessary to deal with political crisis
-   Giving shelter to every refugee may create new problems like human trafficking and  
    drug trafficking and abuse. It will put additional financial and administrative burden  
    on the State.  
    India has already faced a surge of refugees and it has dealt the matter well to the large  
    extent possible without any formal policy. The present Citizenship Amendment bill is a  
    step towards making well framed asylum policy but it is still narrow. In this context a lot  
    needs to be done to wider its ambit so that it can cover all asylum related cases  
    comprehensively.  
    **_5\. Do you think nation states owe a responsibility towards asylum seekers? What are  
    the considerations that should, in your opinion, go into the making of a refugee  
    policy? Provide arguments with contemporary examples._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Briefly define asylum seekers and provide suitable arguments supported by  
    contemporary examples as to why nation states owe a responsibility towards them.
-   Building on your above viewpoint, enlist the considerations for a refugee policy and  
    conclude accordingly.  
    **_Answer:_**

```
Asylum seekers are those who escape their country out of fear and seek protection
elsewhere. For example, people from Syria, Iraq and African nations are knocking at the
European shores as their countries suffer from civil strife, war and lack of resources.
Similarly, Bangladesh and India have been recently facing influx of Rohingyas from
Myanmar.

```
Generally, the response of countries to asylum seekers has been xenophobic in nature. Student Notes:
Arguments, such as, drain on economic resources, fear of loss of jobs, entry of
extremist elements and so on, are given to oppose entry to refugees. For example, in
Europe, Germany had a welcoming attitude towards refugees despite only a partial
public support, whereas other countries such as Hungary and Italy opposed entry to
refugees.
However, humanitarianism demands that humans should be accorded respectful
treatment and meaningful assistance to fellow beings in the event of distress. Humanity
is an end in itself and should not be treated as a means to achieve narrow gains.
Additionally, every human being has equal right on resources of earth. Thus, principle
of non-refoulement which forbids a country receiving asylum seekers from returning
them to a country in which they would be in likely danger of persecution, has become a
norm. Also, given the principle of international solidarity and burden sharing, nation
states do owe a responsibility of protection and basic care towards vulnerable asylum
seekers.
In this context, following considerations should be kept in mind for designing a refugee
policy:
```

-   It must be pragmatic while at the same time guided by principles of humanism and  
    empathy.
-   Case-to-case basis consideration for provision of asylum to individuals and families  
    keeping in mind the threats towards national security.
-   Distinction must be made between refugees who flee to save themselves from  
    prosecution and those who migrate for better opportunities. Priority should be  
    given to the former as they are the emergency cases.
-   Proper resettlement and livelihood policies accompanied by short-term courses to  
    learn local language and customs should be institutionalised by taking help from  
    international agencies.
-   Nations should voluntarily declare their capacity to help and come out with  
    periodic regional reports on this subject supported by logical arguments and  
    evidences.  
    Refugees are not just the responsibility of the nations they seek protection from but  
    rather collective concern of all the nations. One should not see the repeat of a lifeless  
    toddler Aylan Kurdi lying face down on the seashore.

## 1\. Concept of Rights Student Notes:^

Rights are entitlements to perform or not to perform certain actions, OR to be or not to be in  
certain states; OR entitlements that others perform or not perform certain actions OR to be or  
not to be in certain states.

The modern understanding of what actions are permissible and which institutions are just, are  
dominated by the discourse on rights. Rights structure the form of governments, the content of  
laws, and the shape of morality. By accepting a set of rights, one approves a distribution of  
freedom and authority, and also endorses a certain view around what may, must, and must not  
be done.

Rights acquire meaning only in context of a society. Each society makes certain rules to regulate  
the conduct of its constituents. These rules inform its constituents about what is right and what  
is not. The things that are recognized by the society as rightful become the basis of rights. This  
is why the notion of rights changes over a period of time and varies from one society to another.

It is only when the socially recognized claims are written into a law, that they acquire real force.  
In absence of this, they merely remain what are called natural or moral rights. When laws  
recognize some claim, they become enforceable and their enforcement can then be demanded.  
When fellow citizens, institutions or the government do not respect these rights, it is referred  
to as the violation or infringement of our rights. In such circumstances, citizens can approach  
courts to protect their rights. Thus, rights can be defined as the **reasonable claims of persons  
recognized by society and sanctioned by law**.

## 2\. Categories of Rights

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

### 2.1. Natural Rights Student Notes:^

These are status-based rights that become available to the individuals by virtue of their birth as  
human beings. They are supposed to be given by nature or GOD to human beings and thereby,  
are intrinsic to human lives. They are not conferred by law but only enforced by law. For  
example, Right to Life and Liberty.

### 2.2. Human Rights

Human rights are those rights which are considered so fundamental to human dignity and well-  
being that every person should possess these rights. These are plural, universal and high-  
priority rights that aspire to protect all people everywhere from severe political, legal, and  
social abuses. Examples of human rights are the right to freedom of religion, the right to a fair  
trial when charged with a crime, the right not to be tortured, and the right to education.

It is a common assumption that natural rights theory underlines the contemporary human  
rights doctrine. Consequently, many scholars tend to conflate Human Rights with Natural Rights.  
Additionally, the formulation of ‘rights of man’ creates further confusion. However, there are  
subtle differences between the three.

Natural rights stress upon a grounding in only human nature and lay emphasis on the  
endowment of humans with rights by nature. The ‘rights of man’ suggests man as the source of  
rights and hence, views man not only as merely natural but also rational and moral.

In contrast, Human Rights like ‘rights of man’ suggest derivation of rights from the complex  
moral notion of humanity, but not as explicitly. The normative justification of human rights is  
rather more complex in the sense that these rights are thought to be grounded in multiple  
aspects like prudential reasons, practical reasons, morality, human well-being, fundamental  
interests, human needs, agency and autonomy, dignity, fairness, equality and positive freedom.

### 2.3. Legal rights

Legal rights are rights that exist under the rules of legal systems or by virtue of decisions of  
suitably authoritative bodies within them. To put simply, legal rights are those rights, which are  
conferred by the statutes enacted by the legislature.

### 2.4. Constitutional Rights

These are the rights enshrined in the constitution. Some are given special status like  
Fundamental Rights, while others enjoy ordinary status only. For instance, at present, right to  
property is merely a constitutional right under the Indian Constitution.

### 2.5. Civil and Political Rights

These rights are the cornerstones of modern liberal constitutions across the world. Those rights  
concerned with the structures of government and the institutions of public power are labelled  
political rights. While the ones inherently connected to the concept of real citizenship and  
participation in the political process are called as civil rights.

Civil rights are the basic legal rights a person must possess in order to ensure equal citizenship  
for all citizenry. They are the rights that constitute free and equal citizenship and include  
personal, political, and economic rights. These are those rights, which are available to the  
citizens of a country and are conferred to them either by law of the land or the constitution  
itself. For example, Right to Freedom.

Until the middle of the 20th century, civil rights were usually distinguished from ‘political rights’.  
The former included the rights to own property, make and enforce contracts, receive due  
process of law, and worship one’s religion; freedom of speech and the press. But they did not  
include the right to vote or to hold public office. These were thought to be political rights,  
reserved to adult males.

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

The civil-political distinction was used to classify citizens into different categories. However, the Student Notes:  
ideology that a certain segment of the adult citizenry could legitimately possess one bundle of  
rights, while another segment would have to make do with an inferior bundle, became  
increasingly implausible. In the end, the civil-political distinction has not withstood the test of  
time.

### 2.6. Negative and Positive Rights

The conceptual understanding of positive and negative rights revolves around their application.  
The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right  
is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a  
negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a positive right.

Negative rights protect us from against something and are hence, easier to enforce, because it  
simply requires striking down the action that violated them. In contrast, positive rights are  
difficult to implement since it may be difficult or even impossible to fulfill everyone’s positive  
rights if the sum of people’s claims outstrips the resources available.

## 3\. Understanding Fundamental Rights

Some rights, which are **fundamental to our life** , are given a **special status**. They are not only  
listed in a constitution, but also specially protected. Such rights are called **Fundamental Rights**.  
They are called “fundamental” because they are essential for the all-round development of an  
individual and also because they are guaranteed by the fundamental law of the land i.e. the  
constitution itself.

In the Constitution of India, Fundamental Rights are enshrined in Part III, from Articles 12 to 35.  
These not only guarantee political freedom in the country, but are also a check against arbitrary  
actions of the state. Further, they help in establishing the Rule of Law instead of Rule of Men,  
which means that the state cannot act in an arbitrary manner.

In fact, Fundamental Rights serve as the foundation of the Rule of Law by acting as a check on  
the arbitrary action of the state. Further, an independent judiciary, with the power of judicial  
review, acts as a protector of the Fundamental Rights as well as a guardian and guarantor of the  
Rule of Law.

## 4\. Evolution of Fundamental Rights

The inspiration for incorporating fundamental rights into the Constitution was the result of a  
long struggle for freedom and learning from the experiences of world’s leading democracies  
particularly from the Constitution of USA i.e. the Bill of Rights.

In 1928, a series of All Party Conferences headed by Motilal Nehru drafted a constitutional  
scheme, called the Nehru Report. It called for establishing India into a Parliamentary democracy  
and giving protection to minorities.

The famous resolution of 1931 Karachi Session further committed itself to issues of individual  
rights and liberties. This included fundamental civil rights, socio-economic rights like ensuring  
minimum wages and abolition of untouchability and serfdom.

However, the Simon Commission and the Joint Parliamentary Committee, which were  
responsible for the Government of India Act, 1935, had rejected the idea of enacting  
declarations of fundamental rights on the ground that “abstract declarations are useless, unless  
there exist the will and the means to make them effective”. But nationalist opinion, since the  
time of the Nehru Report, was in favour of a Bill of Rights because the experience gathered  
from the British regime was that a subservient Legislature might serve as a handmaid to the  
Executive in committing inroads upon individual liberty.

Regardless of the British opinion, therefore, the makers of our Constitution adopted Student Notes:  
Fundamental Rights to safeguard individual liberty and also for ensuring (together with the  
Directive Principles) social, economic and political justice for every member of the community.  
The Constituent Assembly was also inspired by the Bill of Rights of USA and UK as well as  
France’s Declaration of the Rights of Man.

## 5\. Classes of Fundamental Rights

The fundamental rights as enshrined in part III are generally categorized into following six  
classes:

-   Right to Equality (Art. 14-18)
-   Right to Freedom (Art. 19-22)
-   Right against Exploitation (Art. 23-24)
-   Right to Freedom of Religion (Art. 25-28)

## 6\. Details of Fundamental Rights

### 6.1. Article 12 – Definition of State

#### 6.1.1. Text

In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires, “the State” includes the Government and  
Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local  
or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of  
India.

#### 6.1.2. Description

Article 12 seeks to define the scope of “State” for the purpose of Part III of the Constitution. A  
citizen can approach the Supreme Court on violation of Fundamental Rights by any of the  
bodies included within the definition of the State. In other words, for the purposes of Part III of  
the constitution, the state comprises of the following:

**1.** Government and Parliament of India i.e the Executive and Legislature of the Union  
**2.** Government and Legislature of each State i.e the Executive and Legislature of the various  
States of India  
**3.** All local or other authorities within the territory of India  
**4.** All local and other authorities who are under the control of the Government of India

It includes the Parliament, Union Government, State legislature, State Executive, Local  
Authorities etc.

**Local Authority:** The term Local authority includes the following:

-   **Local government:** According to Entry 5 of the List II of VII Schedule ‘local government’  
    includes a municipal corporation, improvement trust, district boards, mining settlement  
    authorities and other local authorities for the purpose of local self-government or village  
    administration.
-   **Village Panchayat:** In the case of Ajit Singh v. State of Punjab, it was held that within the  
    meaning of the term local authority, village panchayat is also included.

In _Mohammad Yasin v. Town Area Committee_ , the Supreme Court held that to be characterized  
as a ‘local authority’ the authority concerned must;

**1.** Have a separate legal existence as a corporate body  
**2.** Not be a mere government agency but must be legally an independent entity  
**3.** Function in a defined area  
**4.** Be wholly or partly, directly or indirectly, elected by the inhabitants of the area  
**5.** Enjoy a certain degree of autonomy (complete or partial)  
**6.** Be entrusted by statute with such governmental functions and duties as are usually  
entrusted to locally (like health, education, water, town planning, markets, transportation,  
etc.)  
**7.** Have the power to raise funds for the furtherance of its activities and fulfilment of its  
objectives by levying taxes, rates, charges or fees

**Other Authorities:** The term ‘other authorities’ in Article 12 has not been defined either in the  
Constitution or in the general clauses Act, 1897 or in any other statute of India. Therefore, its  
interpretation has caused a good deal of difficulty, and judicial opinion has undergone changes  
over time. Judicial pronouncements have given a wide scope to the expression “other  
authorities” but still the list is not exhaustive.

The functions of a government can be performed either by the governmental departments and Student Notes:  
officials or through autonomous bodies which exist outside the departmental structure. Such  
autonomous bodies may include companies, corporations etc.

Student Notes:
```

Hence, for the purpose of determining what ‘other authorities’ fall under the scope of State,  
the judiciary has given several judgements as per the facts and circumstances of different cases:

-   In the **University of Madras v. Shanta Bai** , the Madras High Court evolved the principle of  
    ‘ejusdem generis’ i.e. of the like nature. It means that only those authorities are covered  
    under the expression ‘other authorities’ which perform governmental or sovereign  
    functions. Further, it cannot include persons, natural or juristic, for example, Unaided  
    universities.
-   In the case of **Ujjammabai v. the State of U.P** ., the court rejected the above restrictive  
    scope and held that the ‘ejusdem generis’ rule could not be resorted to the in interpreting  
    ‘other authorities’. The bodies named under Article 12 have no common genus running  
    through them and they cannot be placed in one single category on any rational basis.
-   In **Rajasthan Electricity Board v. Mohan Lal** , the Supreme Court held that ‘other authorities’  
    would include all authorities created by the constitution or statute on whom powers are  
    conferred by law. Such statutory authority need not be engaged in performing government  
    or sovereign functions. The court emphasized that it is immaterial that the power conferred  
    on the body is of a commercial nature or not.
-   In the case of **R. D. Shetty v/s International Airport Authority** , the Court laid down five  
    tests for a body to be considered “other authority”:  
    o Entire share capital is owned or managed by State.  
    o It enjoys monopoly status.

### 6.2. Article 13

#### 6.2. 1. Description

Article 13 deals with powers of judicial review. It makes the judiciary the guardian of  
Fundamental Rights in the country. It aims to secure the paramount status of the Constitution  
in case of Fundamental Rights. Judicial review is the power of the judiciary to declare any act of  
legislature as ultra vires (beyond the competence of the legislature to make the law) or null and  
void (illegal).

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

#### 6.2. 2. Judicial Review Student Notes:^

It is the power of the judiciary to declare any act of Parliament and State Legislature as “null &  
void” (particular law or a part of it not valid) or “ultra-vires” (doesn’t have authority).

It emerged in USA as an implied power of judiciary in Marbury v/s Madison case, 1803.

Indian Constitution grants the power of judicial review against executive as well as legislative  
explicitly to protect the fundamental rights.

#### 6.2. 2 .1. Provisions

Pre-constitution laws and Fundamental Rights: The pre-constitution laws are not declared  
invalid ab-initio (from the start). They are invalid only when they are inconsistent with any of  
the fundamental rights.

#### 6.2. 3. Doctrine of Eclipse

Article 13(1) states that pre-constitutional laws will be void if they are inconsistent with any  
Fundamental Right. However, if such a Fundamental Right, which ‘eclipses’ the pre-  
constitutional law, is amended to the extent that the pre-constitutional law is no more  
inconsistent with the amended Fundamental Right, then such a law becomes valid again. Such a  
law is said to have come out of the eclipse caused by the Fundamental Rights. This judgment  
was given in Bhikhaji Narayan case(1955).

In the State of Gujarat vs Ambika Mills (1974) case and in Dulare Lodh vs ADJ Kanpur (1984)  
case, the Supreme Court opined that the Doctrine of Eclipse is applicable to both pre and post-  
constitutional laws.

However, this stance was reversed in the K.K. Poonacha vs State Of Karnataka & Others (2010)  
case, wherein the Supreme Court observed that the doctrine of eclipse will apply to only pre-  
Constitution laws which are governed by Article 13(1) and would not apply to post-Constitution  
laws which are governed by Article 13(2).

#### 6.2. 4. Doctrine of Severability

If any legislature passes a law that violates any provision of the Constitution, then such a law is  
declared void by the Court “to the extent of such inconsistency”. Instead of declaring the entire  
law as illegal, only that portion of the law may be removed, which is inconsistent. This is the  
doctrine of severability.

In Minerva Mills Case (1980), the Supreme Court invalidated clause 4 and 5 of Article 368,  
which were added by 42nd Amendment Act in 1976.

#### 6.2. 4 .1. Motor General Trades v/s State of A.P. 1984

-   If a valid section of a law can be separated from the invalid section and the valid section can  
    be considered to form an independent statute, then this section remains valid.
-   If the valid and invalid sections are so mixed up that they cannot be separated then the  
    whole is declared void.
-   After omitting the invalid part, if what remains is very thin and what emerges out is  
    something different, then the entire law is invalid.

#### 6.2. 5. Doctrine of Waiver

Doctrine of waiver means voluntary relinquishment of a known right. It is when a person  
intentionally and with full knowledge, gives away his right to exercise or chooses not to exercise  
that right which the person would otherwise possess. By waiving a right, a person no longer  
gets to assert that right and is precluded from challenging the constitutionality of that law for  
the benefit of which, the right is waived.

This doctrine is based on the principle that a person is the best judge of his own interest and  
when given full knowledge, the person should be allowed to decide for himself. In India, a  
person can waive rights conferred by a statute or rights arising out of a contract, but cannot  
waive constitutional rights or rights guaranteed by the constitution itself.

#### 6.2. 6. Doctrine of Basic Structure Student Notes:^

According to this doctrine there are certain basic structures or basic features of the Constitution,  
which can’t be abridged or taken away by the Parliament by way of constitutional amendment.

Through various verdicts the judiciary has enunciated the following, among others, as basic  
features of the Constitution:

-   Supremacy of the Constitution
-   Republican and Democratic form of government
-   Secular character
-   Separation of Powers
-   Judicial Review
-   Sovereignty
-   Rule of Law
-   Principle of Equality

#### 6.2. 7. Doctrine of Prospective Over-Ruling

An innovation of the United States of America, this was first pronounced by the Supreme Court  
in the Golaknath case, 1967. The SC can overrule its earlier judgment, but the impact will apply  
from the prospective effect and not retrospectively.

### 6.3. Article 14 – Right to Equality

#### 6.3.1. Text

The State shall not deny to **any person** Equality before Law or Equal Protection of Law within  
the territory of India.

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

#### 6.3.2. Description Student Notes:^

#### 6.3.2.1. Equality before Law

-   This implies that all citizens are equal in the eyes of law. It means that-  
    o There will be **absence of any special privileges** in favour of any person,  
    o There will be **equal subjection of all persons** to the ordinary law of the land  
    administered by ordinary law courts,  
    o There will be **no person above the law,** whether rich or poor, high or low, official or  
    non-official.
-   It has been borrowed from the **British tradition**.
-   It is negative in its orientation as the State is **restricted from making any discrimination**  
    **between two citizens**.

#### 6.3.2.2. Equal Protection of Law

-   It implies that the State should ensure that every citizen gets equal protection of law and no  
    one should be deprived of justice because of poverty or any other reason. It means that-  
    o There will be **equality of treatment under equal circumstances** , both in the privileges  
    conferred and liabilities imposed by the laws.  
    o The **like shall be treated alike** without any discrimination. As per the Supreme Court,  
    where equals and unequals are treated differently, Article 14 does not apply.
-   It is borrowed from the **American Constitution**.
-   It is a positive concept as it implies that people **who are in similar circumstances will be**  
    **treated similarly** , but differently from people in different circumstances.

#### 6.3.3 Applicability

Art. 14 grants Right to Equality to all persons whether Indian citizens, foreigners, or even legal  
entities such as a Company. This right is available against state action only.

#### 6.3.4. Exceptions

-   Under **Article 31-C,** the laws made by the state for implementing **DPSPs** contained in **Article**

### 6.4. Article 15 – Right against Discrimination on Certain Grounds

#### 6.4.1. Text

-   The State **shall not discriminate** against any citizen on **grounds only of religion, race, caste,**  
    **sex, place of birth or any of them**
-   No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them,

#### 6.4.2. Applicability Student Notes:^

This right is available to Indian citizens only. Hence foreign nationals can be discriminated  
against vis-à-vis Indian citizens by the Indian state. Similarly, legal entities can also be  
discriminated against. Further while Art. 15(1) is a direction only to the State, Art. 15(2) is  
available against private individuals as well.

#### 6.4.3. Exceptions

-   The State from making any special provision for the **advancement of any socially and**  
    **educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled**  
    **Tribes**. E.g. reservation of seats in legislatures and public educational institutions.  
    o The State can make any special provision for them in so far as such special provisions  
    relate to their **admission to educational institutions including private educational**  
    **institutions** , whether aided or unaided by the State, other than the minority  
    educational institutions referred to in clause (1) of article 30.
-   The State can make special provisions for the **advancement of any economically weaker**  
    **section of citizens** , including reservations in educational institutions.

#### 6.4.4. Reservation Policy Student Notes:^

It is a form of affirmative action whereby a percentage of seats are reserved in the government  
service and educational institutions for the socially and educationally backward communities  
and the Scheduled Castes and Tribes who are inadequately represented in these services and  
institutions.

-   Reservation is provided to **Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other**  
    **Backward Classes (OBCs** ) at the rate of **15%, 7.5% and 27%** respectively in case of direct  
    recruitment on all India basis by open competition.
-   **Persons with Disability Act, 1995** provides for reservation for persons with disabilities in  
    India. Under the Act, persons with disabilities got 3% reservation in both government jobs  
    and higher educational institutions.
-   **10% Reservation t** o Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) was recently provided by 103rd  
    Constitutional Amendment Act, 2018. It amended Articles 15 and 16 to provide reservation  
    to economically weaker section in admission to educational institutions and government  
    posts.

**Judicial pronouncements regarding Reservation**

-   **State of Madras vs Champakam Dorairajan (1951)**  
    o The Supreme Court upheld decision of Madras High Court, which struck down a  
    Government Order of 1927 regarding caste-based reservation in government jobs and  
    educational institutions.  
    ▪ This judgement also made basis of of adding Article 15(4) by the First Constitutional  
    Amendment Act, 1951.
-   **Indra Sawhney vs. Union of India (1992)**  
    o The Judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court by 6:3 majority held that the  
    decision of the Union Government to reserve 27% Government jobs for backward  
    classes – with elimination of Creamy Layer- is constitutionally valid.  
    o The reservation of seats shall only confine to initial appointments and not to  
    promotions, and the total reservations shall not exceed 50 per cent.
-   **M. Nagaraj vs. Union of India (2006)**  
    o A five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court validated parliament’s decision to  
    extend reservations for SCs and STs to include promotions with three conditions:  
    ▪ State has to provide proof for the backwardness of the class benefitting from the  
    reservation.  
    ▪ State has to collect quantifiable data showing inadequacy of representation of that  
    class in public employment.  
    ▪ State has to show how reservations in promotions would further administrative  
    efficiency.
-   **Jarnail Singh v. Lachhmi Narain Gupta (2018)**  
    o The Supreme Court held that the government **need not collect quantifiable data to**  
    **demonstrate backwardness** of public employees belonging to the Scheduled Castes  
    and the Scheduled Tribes (SC/STs) to provide reservations for them in promotions.
-   Recently the Supreme Court upheld **Karnataka Extension of Consequential Seniority to**  
    **Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of Reservation (to the Posts in the Civil**  
    **Services of the State) Act, 2018**. The enactment provides for **consequential seniority** to SCs  
    and STs with restrospective effect from 1978.  
    o Consequential seniority allows reserved category candidates to retain seniority over  
    general category peers. If a reserved category candidate is promoted before a general  
    category candidate because of reservation in promotion, then for subsequent  
    promotion the reserved candidate retains seniority. In effect, consequential seniority

#### 6.4.4. 1 Controversy related to reservation in Private Educational Institutions

-   **Inamdar vs. State of Maharashtra** and **TMA Pai Foundation vs. State of Karnataka** : The  
    Supreme Court opined that government can not introduce quota in private unaided  
    educational institutions as it was violative of Fundamental Rights under Article 19(1)(g),  
    that is, freedom of profession.  
    o The 93rd amendment was enacted to override this verdict.  
    o Supreme Court upheld the validity of the above constitutional amendment.  
    o The central government then passed Central Educational Institutions Act, 2006 to give  
    effect to the provisions of the Constitution.
-   **Ashok Kumar Thakur vs. Union of India case** : upheld the validity of 93rd amendment and  
    Central Educational Institutions Act, 2006. The status of quota in private unaided  
    institutions was left open to be decided in the future.
-   **Society for unaided private schools for Rajasthan vs. Union of India case 2013** —upheld  
    the validity of introduction to quota under Right to Education Act, 2009 even in private  
    unaided institutions. Arguments given by Supreme Court:  
    o Education cannot be treated as a purely commercial enterprise.  
    o Article 21A is an obligation on the State.  
    o Right to Education is a child-centered act rather than an institution-centered act.

#### 6.4.4.2 Controversy related to reservation for Economically Weaker Sections

As per the amendment, up to 10% of seats may be  
reserved for such sections for admission in  
educational institutions. Such reservation will not  
apply to minority educational institutions. The  
reservation of up to 10% for the EWS will be in  
addition to the existing reservation cap of 50%  
reservation for SC, ST and OBCs. The central  
government will notify the “economically weaker  
sections” of citizens on the basis of family income and  
other indicators of economic disadvantage.

For the very first time, economic class is  
constitutionally recognized as vulnerable section & would form the basis of affirmative action  
programme. It is a departure from traditional centrality of caste in deciding affirmative action.

**Arguments in favour of reservation based on economic status**

-   **Need for new deprivation assessment criteria** : Caste, while prominent cause of injustice in  
    India, should not be the sole determinant of the backwardness of a class. This is because of  
    the weakening links between the caste and class in changing circumstances.
-   In **Ram Singh v. Union of India** (2015), SC asserted that social deficiencies may exist beyond  
    the concept of caste (e.g. economic status / gender identity as in transgenders). Hence,  
    there is a need to evolve new yardsticks to move away from caste-centric definition of  
    backwardness, so that the list remains dynamic and most distressed can get benefit of  
    affirmative action.
-   **Increasing dissatisfaction among various sections** : Politically, the class issues have been  
    overpowered by caste issues. This has created a sense of dissatisfaction amongst  
    communities with similar or poorer economic status but excluded from caste-based  
    reservation.

Pending Bills
The Women’s Reservation Bill that is being
nationally debated since 1996 is also based on
the protective provisions of the Article 15.
Constitution (108) Amendment Bill, which was
introduced in the Rajya Sabha in 2008 was also
an attempt to empower woman.
```

**Arguments against extending reservations on economic basis** :

-   **Against equality norm** : To balance the equality of opportunity of backward classes ‘against’  
    the right to equality of everyone else, a cap of 50% was put on the reserved seats. When  
    the quota exceeds 50% limit, it breaches the equality norm.  
    o In **M. Nagaraj v. Union of India** (2006), a Constitution Bench ruled that equality is part  
    of the basic structure of the Constitution. The 50% ceiling is a constitutional  
    requirement without which the structure of equality of opportunity would collapse.
-   **No under-representation** : The upper caste is adequately represented in public employment.  
    It is not clear if the government has quantifiable data to show that people from lower  
    income groups are under-represented in its service.
-   **Problem with the ceiling** : By fixing income ceiling for eligibility at ₹8 lakh a year — same as  
    the ‘creamy layer’ limit above which OBC candidates become ineligible for reservations — a  
    parity has been created between socially & economically backward classes with limited  
    means.
-   **Definition of EWS and allotment of quota** : The issue with current definition of EWS is that  
    it is too broad and would include large sections of population. Further, it also puts families  
    below poverty line and the ones with income of 8 lakh/annum in the same category.  
    o Reservation for SCs/STs and non-creamy layer amongst OBCs has correlation with their  
    respective populations. While there is no such clarity on arriving at the 10% EWS quota.
-   **Challenges in the identification of beneficiaries** : In a country where taxable population is  
    still very low due to misrepresentation of income, implementing economic eligibility criteria  
    would be a bureaucratic nightmare.
-   **‘Pandora’s box’ of demands** : There may be demand from sections of the SCs/STs and OBCs  
    to introduce similar sub-categorization, based on economic criteria, within their respective  
    quotas. It might also fuel demands for new caste-based censuses to expand quota limits  
    based on SC/ST or OBC proportions in the population, or to extend the reservations to  
    private sector jobs. Quota in promotions may also gain widespread acceptability, both  
    among the public and the judiciary.
-   **Shrinking public sector** : With steadily shrinking jobs pool in the Central Government,  
    Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and even banks, 10% reservation will not fulfill  
    expectations.
-   **Anti-Merit** : In common perception, reservation has also become synonymous with anti-  
    merit. With extension of reservation, this opinion might get further ingrained in public  
    psyche. • Tool of populism: Offering reservations has increasingly become tool for political  
    gains in politics. This affects their credibility as a tool for social justice.
-   **Passage of the Bill** : The Bill was not circulated ahead of being introduced, it was not  
    examined by a parliamentary committee & there was hardly any time between its  
    introduction and final discussion.
-   Also, the **Sinho Commission report of 2010** , which the Centre has been citing as the basis  
    for its legislation to grant 10 % reservation to the EWS, never explicitly recommended a  
    reservation for EWS but was only emphatic about ensuring that the EWS get access to all  
    welfare schemes.

**Way Forward**

A 9-judge bench of Supreme Court in Indira  
Sawhney case (1992) had struck down a  
provision that earmarked 10% for the  
economically backward on the grounds that  
Constitution only provides for addressing  
social backwardness. However, any such  
step should carefully be preceded by following considerations-

-   50% ceiling was put in place to **check populism in granting quotas** by the political class. Student Notes:^  
    There must be an institutional mechanism that recommends classes for reservation.
-   Based on the affidavits furnished by the candidates, **independent, transparent and non-**  
    **intrusive verification methods** have to be devised so that reservation provisions cannot be  
    misused easily.
-   The logic of providing reservation to economically backward people can further be carefully  
    extended to **exclude the creamy layers among SC/ST groups**.
-   The demand for reservation must be seen in light of the quality of private sector jobs and  
    wages available to aspirational India. The only way out of the quota quagmire is to create  
    an enabling environment for the **formalization and creation of more and better jobs in the**  
    **private sector.**
-   For a long-term solution, it is important to address the major issues like caste divisions  
    majorly in rural areas, job creation in private sector, skill creation and education.

-   The State can consider any unfilled vacancies of a year which are reserved for being filled Student Notes:^  
    up in that year in accordance with any provision for reservation made under clause (4) or  
    clause (4A) as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year or years  
    and such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the vacancies of the year  
    in which they are being filled up for determining the ceiling of fifty per cent reservation on  
    total number of vacancies of that year.
-   The State can prescribe residence as a condition for certain employment or appointment in  
    a state or union territory or local authority or other authority.
-   The State can provide that the incumbent of an office in connection with the affairs of any  
    religious or denominational institution or any member of the governing body thereof shall  
    be a person professing a particular religion or belonging to a particular denomination.

#### 6.5.4. Issue of reservation in promotions

Although, the SC in **Indira Sawhney Case** had held that the reservation policy cannot be  
extended to promotions, but it was overruled by the **77 th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1995.**  
This amendment introduced **Article 16(4A)** , which provided reservation in promotion to SC/STs.

-   In **Ajit Singh vs. State of Punjab** , the Supreme Court upheld the validity of 77th amendment  
    act and directed to introduce “ **catch up rule** ”**.** The court restored their seniority once  
    promoted at par with the SC/ST candidates who got quick promotions ahead of their batch  
    mates.
-   The Parliament again amended the Constitution through the **85 th Amendment Act, 2001,** to  
    negate the catch up rule directed by Supreme Court. It introduced **promotion with**  
    **consequential seniority.** This act was brought with retrospective effect from 1995.  
    o **Consequential Seniority** means elevation to a senior position consequential to  
    circumstances, and not through normal rules. Illustrating it, suppose there are 100  
    sanctioned posts in a department, out of which 30 are occupied by unreserved  
    candidates, 15 are occupied by reserved candidates and 55 remain ‘vacant’. The  
    reservation is 30%, which implies that 30 posts must be manned by reserved category  
    employees. So, if a reserved category employee is junior to a general category  
    employee, but there is vacancy for reserved category at a senior position, so reserved  
    category employee will be considered senior and promoted above the general category  
    employee.
-   In 2002, Karnataka had brought a similar law, but was struck down by the Supreme Court in  
    2006 in **M. Nagaraj vs. Union of India Case**. The Supreme Court validated the state’s  
    decision to extend reservation in promotion for SCs and STs, but gave direction that the  
    state should provide proof on the following three parameters to it-  
    o **Empirical Data on Backwardness** - of the class benefitting from the reservation.  
    o **Empirical Data on Inadequate Representation** - in the position/service for which  
    reservation in promotion is to be granted.  
    o **Impact on efficiency** - how reservations in promotions would further administrative  
    efficiency.
-   Many stakeholders and petitioners were not satisfied with these criteria and various review  
    petitions were filed on this judgment. It was again taken up in **Jarnail Singh Case** which  
    upheld the 2nd and 3rd criteria of Nagaraj Case. But observed that there is no longer need  
    to collect quantifiable data on the backwardness of SCs and STs. Although it stated that the  
    **exclusion of creamy layer** while applying the principle of reservation is justified, even in the  
    case of SCs and STs.
-   **Faculty Association of AIIMS vs. Union of India, July 2013** - In this case, a five judge bench  
    of the Supreme Court ruled that there are certain jobs for which merit alone should be the  
    sole criteria.  
    o The Union Government appealed against this judgment and in the review petition a  
    five-judge bench in January 2014, threw the ball back into the Central Government’s

```
court saying that the Government was free to amend the Constitution to provide Student Notes:
reservation in faculty for superspeciality posts and that the previous judgment did not
place any restriction on the Government to decide whether or not there should be
reservation in superspeciality posts.
```

-   In 2019, the Supreme Court had permitted the Central government for reservation in  
    promotion to SC/ST employees working in the public sector in “accordance with law”.
-   The Karnataka government set up the Ratna Prabha Committee to submit a report on the  
    three criteria and based on its report had come up with the revised bill. This time, the court  
    has upheld it constitutionally.

**Way Forward**

-   Caste is not a matter of identity or right, when it comes to administrative policy. At  
    difference levels, studies and empirical data should to be collected to decide the level of  
    promotions needed.
-   The Constitution envisages not just a formal equality of opportunity but also the  
    achievement of substantive equality. Currently, there is ambiguity in promotion process.  
    Thus, there is a need for a new, comprehensive law to be enacted.

#### 6.5.5 Issue of Local Reservation in Private Sector Jobs

Recently, Haryana Cabinet cleared a draft ordinance that seeks to reserve 75% of the jobs in  
private enterprises for local residents to address the aspect of unemployment of the local  
population on a priority basis.

**Background**

-   A survey done by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) in 2016 showed  
    that nearly two- third of respondents were in favour that people from the state should be  
    given priority vis-à-vis employment opportunities.
-   Similar demands are being raised in other states like Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh,  
    Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra etc. o Last year similar 75% job reservation to locals was

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
given in Andhra Pradesh but the matter is sub judice and AP High Court has indicated that it Student Notes:
may be unconstitutional.
```

-   Such moves are considered mainly to promote Inclusive Development. For example, in  
    Germany, every village has a factory. India could also have industries in villages and provide  
    jobs to the local people for an all-round development. However, there should be an  
    overarching framework at the Union level to promote such development.

**Issues with implementation of the ordinance**

-   **May not pass the legal scrutiny-** It is violative of Article 14 (Right to equality) and Art 1 6  
    (Right to equal opportunity). Moreover, Article 16 does not empower the state government  
    but rather the Parliament to provide reservation in jobs on the basis of residence but that  
    too is limited to public sector.
-   **Dangerous for unity of the country** - Such moves could lead to a Pandora’s box where other  
    states start implementing such policies, which result in fractures in the unity of India.
-   **Concerns of the Industry** - Although, most of the units employ locals only, however, there  
    are certain sectors like chemical technology, textile and biotechnology, where it may be  
    difficult to find locals for the jobs and the units are forced to search outside.  
    o It will likely facilitate corruption and create another barrier to ease of doing business.

```
o Difficult to attract investments - Such a decision may lead to relocation of industries Student Notes:
elsewhere and also alienate the potential investors. Lack of investments could further
drop the job creation.
o Plan may not impact micro or smaller units as they can still engage localites. However,
medium and large- scale companies and MNCs like Auto industry which contributes
more than 25% of the state GDP of Haryana will be adversely impacted.
o Since these industrial units cannot ‘import’ labourers from elsewhere; the burden of
imparting the requisite skills to, and of employing, locals will fall on the units.
```

**Way Forward**

-   **Need to tackle the core issues** - of unemployment by more job creation and  
    industrialisation rather than such moves.  
    o Governments should provide incentives to industries for more investments and create  
    an enabling environment for it. The Economic Survey 2018-19 also alerts the policy  
    makers against such policy uncertainties for the industries, which may rather impact  
    economic development.  
    o Government should focus on making the youth of a state employable with proper  
    investments in education, health and skill development.
-   **Need to promote labour intensive industries-** to make use of the labour surplus in the  
    country, rather than simply forcing any industry for the locals.
-   **Need to promote entrepreneurship** - where people are themselves motivated to create  
    livelihood for them. State can provide incentives and help here such as done for Dalit  
    entrepreneurs in Maharashtra.
-   **Need to move towards economy-based reservation** - rather than further expansion of  
    reservation policies using unproductive rationales.

**Conclusion**

Job reservation for locals may not enhance their economic opportunities in the long run. Only,  
raising the standard of education and skilling youth alongside the necessary structural reforms  
is the only way to increase the size of the economic pie in the absolute sense.

#### 6.5.6 Job Reservations, Promotion Quotas Not A Fundamental Right

Recently, the Supreme Court take a case pertaining to decision by the Uttarakhand government  
in 2012. Back then, the government had decided to fill up posts in public services without  
providing reservation to members of the Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST)  
communities. The Uttarakhand High Court directed the state government in 2019 to implement  
reservations in promotion by promoting only SCs and STs to maintain the quota earmarked for  
the said categories.

The Court held that Article 16 (4) and 16 (4-A) are in the **nature of enabling provisions** , vesting  
a **discretion on the State Government** to consider providing reservations, if the circumstances  
so warrant. It is settled law that the state cannot be directed to give reservations for  
appointment in public posts. The order further adds that the state is not bound to make a  
reservation for SCs and STs in matters of promotions. The court said that no mandamus can be  
issued by the court directing state governments to provide reservations.

However, if the state wishes to exercise its discretion and make such provision, it has to collect  
quantifiable data showing ‘inadequacy of representation of that class in public services. If the  
decision of the state government to provide reservations in promotion is challenged then the  
state concerned will have to place before the court the quantifiable data that reservations  
became necessary on account of inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs without affecting  
general efficiency of administration as mandated by Article 335.

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

**Analysis of Judgement** Student Notes:

-   The fact that reservation cannot be claimed as a fundamental right is a settled position  
    under the law and has been pointed out by several judgments in the past.  
    o In 1967, a five-judge bench in **C.A. Rajendran v. Union of India** held that the  
    government is under no constitutional duty to provide reservations for SCs and STs,  
    either at the initial stage of recruitment or at the stage of promotion.  
    o The position went on to be **reiterated in several other decisions** , including the nine-  
    judge bench ruling in **Indra Sawhney v. Union of India** (1992) and the five-judge bench  
    decision in **M Nagaraj v. Union of India** (2006).
-   Although this position of law is a settled one, it is nonetheless **at odds with certain other**  
    **principles** at the heart of the **constitutional vision of equality**.  
    o In **NM Thomas judgement** (1976), the Supreme Court held that the Constitution was  
    committed to an idea of substantive equality, i.e. it had to take the **actual**  
    **circumstances of people** into account when determining what constituted “equal  
    treatment”.  
    o The **principled reason for this position** was that groups of people who face structural  
    and institutional barriers towards being able to compete on “equal terms” with others  
    in society — for reasons that are historical, but whose effects are enduring — must be  
    treated in a way that mitigates those existing conditions of inequality.  
    o **Reservations** — under this understanding — were a means to bring about genuine and  
    true equality, and not a set of privileges or gifts.
-   To interpret the obligations of the state purely from the textual foundations of Article 16 is  
    not an appropriate approach. Fundamental rights are not isolated provisions and ought to  
    be looked into as an interconnected whole.
-   As there are **less avenues for the direct appointment in higher posts** , reservations play a  
    major role for the representation of backward classes in higher posts.  
    o According to a Parliament reply last year, only one of the 89 secretaries posted at the  
    Centre belonged to the SC, while three belong to the ST. The court order may go against  
    the substantive equality in higher posts.
-   The Supreme Court is **not wrong** in saying that a **writ of mandamus cannot be granted** by  
    any court in order to enforce an enabling provision. The writ of mandamus is issued only to  
    compel an authority to discharge a binding duty.

**Conclusion**

It is a settled principle of law that a **discretionary power cannot be exercised in a fickle manner**.  
Simply because the exercise of a power is optional for the government does not mean that it  
can be exercised in a whimsical manner. Article 14 of the Indian Constitution has been  
interpreted to prohibit all kinds of arbitrary decisions by the government. Thus, the **courts are  
entitled to examine if a discretionary power has been exercised in a judicious manner**.

### 6.6. Article 17 – Abolition of Untouchability

#### 6.6.1. Text

The Constitution abolishes ‘untouchability’ and forbids its practice in any form. The  
enforcement of any disability arising out of untouchability shall be an offence punishable in  
accordance with law.

#### 6.6.2. Description

Untouchability is banned in any form in our country. Under **Article 3** 5, the Parliament has made  
**2 enabling Acts** to enforce this provision. Notably, the Constitution has not defined the term  
“untouchability”. However, the Mysore High Court held that the subject matter of Article 17 is  
not untouchability in its literal or grammatical sense but the ‘practice as it had developed

historically in the country’. It refers to the social disabilities imposed on certain classes of Student Notes:  
persons by reason of their birth in certain castes. Hence, it does not cover social boycott of a  
few individuals or their exclusion from religious services, etc.

#### 6.6.3. The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955

Initially named as **Untouchabilities (Offences) Act, 1955** , it was amended in 1976 and renamed  
as The Protection of Civil Rights Act. It makes provisions against untouchability stronger.  
Further, a person convicted of the offence of untouchability is disqualified as a candidate for  
elections to the Parliament and State Legislature.

Untouchability is a cognizable offence (police officer can arrest the accused without a  
magisterial warrant) and a non-compoundable offence (cases which cannot be withdrawn even  
if a compromise is reached between disputing parties; the State becomes a party). It provides  
for a special court for speedy trial. The act declares the **following acts as offences** :

-   Preventing any person from entering any place of public worship or from worshipping  
    therein;
-   Justifying untouchability on traditional, religious, philosophical or other grounds;
-   Denying access to any shop, hotel or places of public entertainment;
-   Insulting a person belonging to scheduled caste on the ground of untouchability;
-   Refusing to admit persons in hospitals, educational institutions or hostels established for  
    public benefit;
-   Preaching untouchability directly or indirectly; and (g) refusing to sell goods or render  
    services to any person.

The Supreme Court held that the right under Article 17 is available against private individuals  
and it is the constitutional obligation of the State to take necessary action to ensure that this  
right is not violated.

#### 6.6.4. The Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe Prevention of Atrocities Act,

#### 1989

-   Its main objective is prevention of atrocities by increased surveillance, collecting licenses of  
    upper castes etc.
-   Provides relief and rehabilitation measures for the victims.
-   Provides for special court and special police.
-   In some situations, police can even provide arms to members of SC and ST community for  
    self-defence.

**Recent Developments**  
To curb the misuse of Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities POA) Act, 1989, Supreme  
Court in March 2018 diluted the Act in **Subhash Kashinath Mahajan vs State of Maharashtra case.**

-   **Anticipatory Bail** : Supreme Court laid down safeguards, including provisions for anticipatory bail  
    and a “preliminary enquiry” on whether complaint under the 1989 law is “frivolous or motivated”  
    before registering a case.
-   **FIR** : Neither is an FIR to be immediately registered nor are arrests to be made without a preliminary  
    inquiry. An arrest could only be made if there is “credible” information and police officer has  
    “reason to believe” that an offence was committed.
-   **Permission** : Even if a preliminary inquiry was held and a case registered, arrest is not necessary, and  
    that no public servant is to be arrested without the written permission of the appointing authority.  
    This judgment had triggered widespread protests and violence and the **government had to amend the  
    Act** to negate the effect of the apex court ruling. In August 2018, amendment **restored the bar against  
    anticipatory bail and nullifying the apex court verdict.**
-   A new section 18A was inserted in the Act of 1989, which does away with the **court-imposed**  
    **requirements of undertaking preliminary inquiry and of procuring approval prior to making an**  
    **arrest.**

-   It also asserted that in cases under the Atrocities Act, **no procedure other than that specified under** Student Notes:  
    **the Act and Cr. P. C. shall apply.**  
    Later on, Supreme court reserved its verdict on the petitions challenging the validity of 2018  
    amendments to The Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. It **restored the  
    earlier position of the law by recalling two directions in the March, 2018 verdict** , which provided no  
    absolute bar on grant of anticipatory bail and prior inquiry before effecting arrest of public servant and  
    private individual under the Act.

### 6.7. Article 18

#### 6.7.1. Text

Abolition of titles.

1.  No title, not being a military or academic distinction, shall be conferred by the State.
2.  No citizen of India shall accept any title from any foreign State.
3.  No person who is not a citizen of India shall, while he holds any office of profit or trust  
    under the State, accept without the consent of the President any title from any foreign  
    State.
4.  No person holding any office of profit or trust under the State shall, without the consent of  
    the President, accept any present, emolument, or office of any kind from or under any  
    foreign State.

#### 6.7.2. Description

-   It is a restriction on the powers of the State, citizens and non-citizens.
-   The State must not give any titles except a military or an academic one.
-   No citizen of India is allowed to accept any title from a foreign state.
-   A foreign citizen holding any office of profit or office of trust under the Indian State is not  
    allowed to accept any title, present, emolument, or office of any kind from a foreign state  
    without the permission of the President of India.

#### 6 .7.3. Case of Bharat Ratna and Padma Awards

In **Balaji Raghavan case** , the SC allowed the State to give Bharat Ratna and Padma awards but  
made it clear that these couldn’t be used as a title. These National Awards were instituted in

1954.  The Janata Party government headed by Morarji Desai discontinued them in 1977. But  
    they were again revived in 1980 by the Indira Gandhi government.

### 6.8. Article 19 – Right to Freedom

#### 6.8.1. Text

All citizens shall have the right—

a) to freedom of speech and expression;  
b) to assemble peaceably and without arms;  
c) to form associations or unions;  
d) to move freely throughout the territory of India;  
e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; and  
f) to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.

Originally, Article 19 contained seven rights. But, the right to acquire, hold and dispose of  
property was deleted by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978.

#### 6.8.2. Applicability

Rights under Article 19 are protected against only state action and not private individuals.  
Moreover, these rights are available only to the citizens and to shareholders of a company but  
not to foreigners or legal persons like companies or corporations, etc. The State can impose

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

‘reasonable’ restrictions on the enjoyment of these six rights only on the grounds mentioned in Student Notes:  
the Article 19 itself and not on any other grounds.

Article 19 is suspended automatically if proclamation is on ground of external aggression, and  
remains so, as long as emergency is in operation. However, after the 44th Amendment, it cannot  
be suspended if the emergency is declared on the grounds armed rebellion.

#### 6.8.3 Freedom of Speech and Expression

Under this article, every citizen has the right to express his v **iews, opinions, belief and  
convictions freely by word of mouth, writing, printing, picturing or in any other manner.** The  
Supreme Court held that the freedom of speech and expression includes the following:

-   Right to propagate one’s views as well as views of others.
-   Freedom of the press.
-   Freedom of commercial advertisements.
-   Right against tapping of telephonic conversation.
-   Right to telecast, that is, government has no monopoly on electronic media.
-   Right against bundh called by a political party or organisation.
-   Right to know about government activities.
-   Freedom of silence.
-   Right against imposition of pre-censorship on a newspaper
-   Right to demonstration or picketing but not right to strike

The State can **impose reasonable restrictions** on the exercise of the freedom of speech and  
expression **on the grounds of** sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the state, friendly  
relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation,  
and incitement to an offence.

#### 6.8.4. Freedom of Assembly

Under this article, every citizen has the right to assemble peaceably and without arms. It  
includes the right to hold public meetings, demonstrations and take out processions. This  
freedom can be exercised only on public land and the assembly must be peaceful and unarmed.  
This provision does not protect violent, disorderly, riotous assemblies, or one that causes  
breach of public peace or one that involves arms. This right does not include the right to strike.

The State can impose **reasonable restrictions** on the exercise of right of assembly on two  
grounds, namely, sovereignty and integrity of India and public order including the maintenance  
of traffic in the area concerned.

-   Under **Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (1973),** a magistrate can restrain an  
    assembly, meeting or procession if there is a risk of obstruction, annoyance or danger to  
    human life, health or safety or a disturbance of the public tranquillity or a riot or any affray.
-   Under **Section 141 of the Indian Penal Code** , as assembly of five or more persons becomes  
    unlawful if the object is-  
    o to resist the execution of any law or legal process;  
    o to forcibly occupy the property of some person;  
    o to commit any mischief or criminal trespass;  
    o to force some person to do an illegal act; and  
    o to threaten the government or its officials on exercising lawful powers.

#### 6.8.5. Freedom of Association

Under this, all citizens have the right to form associations or unions or **co-operatives (** 97 th  
Amendment Act **)** has been added. It includes the right to form political parties, companies,  
partnership firms, societies, clubs, organisations or any body of persons. It not only includes the  
right to start an association or union but also to continue with the association or union as such.

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

Further, it covers the negative right of not to form or join an association or union. Student Notes:

**Reasonable restrictions** can be imposed on the exercise of this right by the State on the  
grounds of **sovereignty and integrity of India, public order and morality.** The Supreme Court  
held that the trade unions have no guaranteed right to effective bargaining or right to strike or  
right to declare a lock-out. The right to strike can be controlled by an appropriate industrial law.

#### 6.8.6. Freedom of Movement

Under this, every citizen can move freely from one state to another or from one place to  
another within a state. This right underline the idea that India is one unit so far as the citizens  
are concerned. Thus, the purpose is to promote national feeling and not parochialism.

**Reasonable restrictions** on this freedom are two, namely, the interests of general public and  
the protection of interests of any scheduled tribe. The entry of outsiders in tribal areas is  
restricted to protect the distinctive culture, language, customs and manners of scheduled tribes  
and to safeguard their traditional vocation and properties against exploitation.

The Supreme Court held that the freedom of movement of prostitutes can be restricted on the  
ground of public health and in the interest of public morals. The Bombay High Court validated  
the restrictions on the movement of persons affected by AIDS.

The freedom of movement has two dimensions, viz, **internal** (right to move inside the country)  
and **external** (right to move out of the country and right to come back to the country). **Article  
19** protects only the first dimension. The second dimension is dealt by **Article 21** (right to life  
and personal liberty).

#### 6.8.7. Freedom of Residence

Every citizen has the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of the country. This  
right has two parts:

-   The right to reside in any part of the country, which means to stay at any place temporarily,  
    and
-   The right to settle in any part of the country, which means to set up a home or domicile at  
    any place permanently.

This right is intended to remove internal barriers within the country or between any of its parts.  
This promotes nationalism and avoids narrow mindedness. The State can impose **reasonable  
restrictions on the exercise of this right on two grounds,** namely, the **interest of general public  
and the protection of interests of any scheduled tribes**.

The right of outsiders to reside and settle in tribal areas is restricted to protect the distinctive  
culture, language, customs and manners of scheduled tribes and to safeguard their traditional  
vocation and properties against exploitation. In many parts of the country, the tribals have been  
permitted to regulate their property rights in accordance with their customary rules and laws.

The Supreme Court held that certain areas can be banned for certain kinds of persons like  
prostitutes and habitual offenders.

#### 6.8.8. Freedom of Profession

Under this, all citizens are given the right to practise any profession or to carry on any  
occupation, trade or business. This right is very wide as it covers all the means of earning one’s  
livelihood. The State can impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of this right in the  
interest of the general public. Further, the State is empowered to:

-   Prescribe professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or  
    carrying on any occupation, trade or business; and
-   Carry on by itself any trade, business, industry or service whether to the exclusion  
    (complete or partial) of citizens or otherwise

Thus, no objection can be made when the State carries on a trade, business, industry or service Student Notes:  
either as a monopoly (complete or partial) to the exclusion of citizens (all or some only) or in  
competition with any citizen. The State is not required to justify its monopoly. This right does  
not include the right to carry on a profession or business or trade or occupation that is immoral  
(trafficking in women or children) or dangerous (harmful drugs or explosives, etc,). The State  
can absolutely prohibit these or regulate them through licencing.

#### 6.8.9. Issues related to Rights under Article 19

#### 6.8.9.1 Status of Freedom of Press

Unlike several countries such as USA, there is no separate provision guaranteeing the freedom  
of press, but the Supreme Court in Sakaal paper v/s Union of India case, has held that the  
freedom of press is included in the “freedom of expression” under Article 19(1) (a). In Brij  
Bhushan case, SC clarified that there is no prior censorship on the media, i.e., no prior  
permission is needed.

44 th amendment, 1976 introduced Article 361A that provides protection to a person publishing  
proceedings of the Parliament and State Legislatures.

In Indian Express case, it was clarified that the Freedom of Press includes:

-   Right to Information
-   Right to Publish
-   Right to Circulate

In 1997, **the Prasar Bharti Act** granted autonomy to Doordarshan and All India Radio (which  
means it can criticize the state policies and actions).

In 1966, **Press Council of India** was created to regulate the print media. PCI has a retired SC  
judge as its chairperson (by convention) and 28 other members.

-   20 members are the representatives from the media
-   5 members are nominated by Parliament
-   3 members – one each come from UGC, Sahitya Kala Academy and Bar Council of India

The National Commission to Review the Working of Constitution (NCRWC) recommended that  
Freedom of Press be explicitly granted and not be left implied in the Freedom of Speech.

#### 6.8. 9. 2 Control of Social and Broadcast Media

Media in India is against external regulation. But it is realized that self-regulation may turn out  
to be no regulation at all. Hence PCI sought to bring electronic and social media under its ambit.

According to PCI chairperson, there is difference between regulation and control.

There are two rights on which media claims independence –

-   Article 19(1) (a) – Under freedom of speech expression
-   Article 19(1) (g) – Freedom to practice any profession, occupation, trade or business

Neither of these rights is absolute. Moreover, media cannot claim to be a purely commercial  
venture.

Levenson Report on Media in Britain – also calls for regulation of media.

#### 6.8.9. 3. Freedom of Speech and Civil Servants

According to the Supreme Court, freedom of speech for civil servants can be curtailed in the  
interests of discipline even though such a restriction is not mentioned in Article 19 (2). Service  
rules are essential for discipline within services. The objective here is not to curb the freedom  
of speech of civil servants but to ensure that they are able to effectively discharge their duties.  
Hence, there is balance to be maintained between organizational functioning and freedom of

speech. Such restrictions, however, do not apply to an elected representative in an organization Student Notes:  
as he represents people.

#### 6.8.9. 4. Sedition

As per Section 124A of IPC, Sedition is an act that brings or attempts to bring into hatred or  
contempt or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government established by  
law in India by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or  
otherwise. As per this Section, a person is liable to be punished with imprisonment for life or  
imprisonment up to three years with fine.

The section 124A of Indian Penal Code is a pre- independence provision, which covers sedition  
charges against government. Various verdicts by Indian Judiciary have led to re-interpretation  
and re-examination of ‘sedition’ in light of Article 19 of the Constitution. There has been an  
effort to strike a balance between right to free speech and expression and power of State to  
impose reasonable restrictions (Article 19(2)).

**Views of the Supreme Court**

-   In 1962, the Supreme Court in **Kedar Nath Singh vs. State of Bihar** upheld Section 124A  
    and held that it struck a “correct balance” between fundamental rights and the need for  
    public order.
-   The court had significantly reduced the scope of Sedition law to only those cases where  
    there is incitement to imminent violence towards overthrow of the state.

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   Further, the Court held that it is not mere against government of the day but the Student Notes:^  
    institutions as symbol of state.
-   Various verdicts in Romesh Thappar, Kanahiya Kumar case re- defined a seditious act only if  
    it had essential ingredients as:  
    o Disruption of public order,  
    o Attempt to violently overthrow a lawful government,  
    o Threatening the security of State or of public

**Views of the Law Commission**

-   While it is essential to protect national integrity, it should not be misused as a tool to curb  
    free speech. Dissent and criticism are essential ingredients of a robust public debate on  
    policy issues as part of vibrant democracy.
-   Hence, Section 124A should be invoked only in cases where the intention behind any act is  
    to disrupt public order or to overthrow the government with violence and illegal means.

**Way Forward**

-   The guidelines of the SC must be incorporated in Section 124A as well by amendment to  
    IPC so that any ambiguity must be removed. A private member bill was introduced in 2015  
    to amend this section. The Bill suggested that only those actions/words that directly result  
    in the use of violence or incitement to violence should be termed seditious.
-   The state police must be sufficiently guided as to where the section must be imposed and  
    where not.

-   Need to include provisions where the government can be penalized, if it misuses the Student Notes:^  
    section. This will ensure that section 124 A of IPC strikes a balance between security and  
    smooth functioning of state with the fundamental right of freedom of speech and  
    expression.

#### 6.8.9. 5. Hate Speech

Hate speech poses complex challenge to freedom of speech and expression. However, the  
question is what should be considered as a hate speech without curbing the freedom of speech  
and expression. In this regard, Law Commission has defined it as “incitement to hatred  
primarily against a group of persons defined in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual  
orientation, religious belief and the like”. Thus, “hate speech is any word written or spoken,  
signs, visible representations within the hearing or sight of a person with the intention to cause  
fear or alarm, or incitement to violence.”

**T.K. Viswanathan committee** , constituted by the Centre, has recommended introducing  
stringent provisions for hate speech.

**Observations of the Committee**

-   It was of the opinion that it was more effective to insert the substantive provisions in the  
    IPC instead of the IT Act, since the IT Act was primarily concerned with e-commerce  
    regulation.
-   **Section 78 of the IT Act** primarily ‘dealt with capacity building’ and needs to be relooked to  
    sensitize the officers and give them support with electronic expertise, computer- forensics  
    and digital-forensics.
-   It has **recommended amendments in CrPC** to enable each state to have a **State Cyber**  
    **Crime Coordinator** (Sec 25B) and a **District Cyber Crime Cell** (Sec 25C).
-   The offensive speech should be “highly disparaging, abusive or inflammatory against any  
    person or group of persons”, and should be uttered with the intention to cause “fear of  
    injury or alarm”.
-   The committee also expressed the desirability of having **guidelines in place to prevent the**  
    **abuse of provisions by investigation agencies** and to safeguard innocent users of social  
    media.
-   Many recommendations were taken from the Law Commission report, which are-  
    o Insertion of Section 153C to prohibit incitement of hatred through online speech on  
    grounds of religion, caste, community, gender, sexual orientation, tribe, language, place  
    of birth etc.  
    o Section 505A was proposed to be inserted by the Law Commission to prevent causing  
    of alarm, fear, provocation of violence etc. on grounds of identity.  
    o It was clarified that the need for intent has to be established.

**Concerns associated with Committee’s recommendations** –

-   The Law Commission identifies the status of the author of the speech, the status of victims  
    of the speech, the potential impact of the speech, in order to qualify something as **Hate**  
    **Speech**. However, these concerns are apparently **not well reflected in the committee**  
    **report.**
-   Besides, **extremely broad** terms like, highly disparaging, indecent, abusive, inflammatory,  
    false or grossly offensive information, etc., have been used by the report which takes us  
    back to the ambiguity that the section 66A held.

```
Conclusion
```

-   It is vital to examine the **context in which speech is made** in order to properly determine  
    the motivation behind it – and the effect it is likely to have. The dangerousness of speech

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
cannot be estimated outside the context in which it was made or disseminated, and its Student Notes:
original message can become lost in translation.
```

-   Supreme Court in **Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan v. Union of India in 2014** , states that hate  
    speech must be viewed through the lens of the right to equality. However, few loopholes  
    need to be plugged when it comes to regulation of hate speeches, so as to transform our  
    country from being a procedural democracy to also a substantive one.

#### 6.8.9. 6 Defamation

In 2016, Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the country’s colonial-era criminal  
defamation laws, ruling that they are not in conflict with the right to free speech. Under  
sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code, defamation is a criminal offence. Defamatory  
acts can include “words either spoken or intended to be read”, signs or visible representations,  
which are published or put up in the public domain. The offence is punishable with up to two  
years imprisonment, a fine or both.

**Why it should be retained?**

-   **Reputation** of an individual, constituent in **Article 21** is an equally important right as free  
    speech.
-   Criminalization of defamation to protect individual dignity and reputation is a “ **reasonable**  
    **restriction** ”
-   Editors have to take the responsibility of everything they publish as it has far-reaching  
    consequences in an individual and country’s life
-   The acts of expression should be looked at both from the perspective of the speaker and  
    the place at which he speaks, the audience etc.
-   It has been part of statutory law for over 70 years. It has neither diluted our vibrant  
    democracy nor abridged free speech
-   Protection for “legitimate criticism” on a question of public interest is available in the  
    o Civil law of defamation &  
    o Under exceptions of Section 499 IPC
-   Mere misuse or abuse of law can never be a reason to render a provision unconstitutional  
    rather lower judiciary must be sensitized to prevent misuse
-   Monetary compensation in civil defamation is not proportional to the excessive harm done  
    to the reputation

**Significance of this judgement**

-   The judgement raises reputation to the level of “shared value of the collective” and elevates  
    it to the status of a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution.
-   According to the judgement, the theory of balancing of rights dictates that along with the  
    right to freedom of speech and expression, there is a correlative duty on citizens not to  
    interfere with the liberty of others, as everyone is entitled to the dignity of person and of  
    reputation.

**Why it should be retained?**

-   Freedom of speech and expression of media is important for a vibrant democracy and the  
    threat of prosecution alone is enough to suppress the truth. Many times the influential  
    people misuse this provision to suppress any voices against them.
-   Considering anecdotal evidence, every dissent may be taken as unpalatable criticism.
-   The right to reputation cannot be extended to collectives such as the government, which  
    has the resources to set right damage to their reputations.
-   The process in the criminal cases itself becomes a punishment for the accused as it requires  
    him to be personally present along with a lawyer on each date of hearing.

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   Given that a civil remedy to defamation already exists, no purpose is served by retaining the Student Notes:^  
    criminal remedy except to coerce, harass and threaten.
-   It goes against the global trend of decriminalizing defamation  
    o Many countries, including neighbouring Sri Lanka, have decriminalized defamation.  
    o In 2011, the Human Rights Committee of the International Covenant on Civil and  
    Political Rights called upon states to abolish criminal defamation, noting that it  
    intimidates citizens and makes them shy away from exposing wrongdoing.

#### 6.8.9. 7 Banning of films and books

In India, there have been regular protests and violence over the publication of a book, cartoon  
or release of a movie which certain sections claim as to be offensive to them. They resort to  
violence, protests and shutdowns resulting in damage to life and property. As a result,  
governments often ban such expression of arts citing law and order problem. This directly  
surmounts to curbing the freedom of speech and expression of the artists and stifling the free  
speech in the country. In this context, SC in several judgments has held such bans to be illegal. It  
has opined that once an expert body has cleared the film, it is no excuse to say that there may  
be a law and order situation. It is for the government to see that law and order is maintained. In  
any democratic society there are bound to be divergent views. Merely because a small section  
of the society has a different view and choose to express their views by unlawful means can be  
no ground for such bans. It is the duty of the government to ensure law and order.

#### 6.8.9.8. Right to access internet

Recently, Supreme Court has delivered verdict on a bunch of petitions challenging the  
restrictions imposed on internet services and movement of people in Jammu and Kashmir.

**Internet shutdowns**

-   India **tops the list** of Internet shutdowns globally. According to Software Freedom Law  
    Center’s tracker, there have been 381 shutdowns since 2012, 106 of which were in 2019.
-   The ongoing **shutdown in Kashmir is the longest ever** in any democratic country.
-   **Legislative provisions** :  
    o Suspension of Internet services are dealt with under the Information Technology Act,  
    2000, the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), 1973 and the Telegraph Act, 1885.  
    o **Before 2017** , Internet suspension orders were issued underSection 144 of the CrPC. But,  
    in 2017, the central government notified the Temporary Suspension of Telecom  
    Services (Public Emergency or Public Service) Rules under the Telegraph Act to govern  
    suspension of Internet.  
    ▪ Despite the 2017 rules, the government has often used the broad powers under  
    Section 144 CrPC.
-   **Economic cost** : India lost over $1.3 billion in internet shutdowns across the country in 2019  
    — making it the third-most economically affected country after Iraq and Sudan.
-   **Justifications for shutdowns** : o The shutdown is based on analysis of intelligence inputs.  
    This is a preventive measure used by the law & order administration as a last resort to  
    address mass protests, civil unrest, so as to ensure peace. o In certain extreme situations  
    where rumours through WhatsApp and other social media start playing a disruptive role, it  
    may become necessary to have internet shutdowns**.**

**Arguments against**

-   Internet activists, law experts, and human rights agencies suggest that there **is no real**  
    **evidence of Internet shutdown actually helping in preventing mass protests** or civil unrest.
-   Internet shutdowns make **human rights a hostage to the whims of the executive** : the  
    fundamental rights to speech, conduct business, access healthcare, express dissent, and  
    movement of the people in a state, are compromised.

-   Shutting the internet results is an information blackout that **can also create hysteria, panic** Student Notes:^  
    and can result in even more discord.

**Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Service) Rules, 2017  
(Suspension Rules)**

-   These Rules were **framed by ministry of communications and derive their powers from Section 5(2)**  
    **of the Indian Telegraph Act** , which talks about interception of messages in the “interests of the  
    sovereignty and integrity of India”.
-   It **empowers the government to block transmission of messages** in case of a public emergency or  
    for public safety in any part of the country.
-   Any order suspending internet under the Rules, **can be only for a temporary duration** and not for an  
    indefinite period.
-   Directions to suspend the telecom services shall not be issued except **by Home Secretary of the**  
    **country and a secretary of a state’s home department** and that order should be taken up by a  
    review committee within five days.  
    **UN Resolution on Internet Shutdown**
-   In 2016, the United Nations Human Rights Council released a non-binding resolution condemning  
    intentional disruption of internet access by governments.
-   The resolution reaffirmed that "the same rights people have offline must also be protected online”.

**Supreme Court’s observation On Internet shutdown**

-   Freedom of speech and expression through the medium of internet is a fundamental right  
    under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.
-   The restrictions on internet have to follow the principles of proportionality under Article  
    19(2).  
    o Doctrine of proportionality is a principle that is prominently used as a ground for  
    judicial review in cases of administrative action.  
    o The doctrine essentially signifies that the punishment should not be disproportionate  
    to the offence committed or the nature and extent of the State’s interference with the  
    exercise of a right must be proportionate to the goal it seeks to achieve.
-   Freedom of trade and commerce through internet is also a constitutionally protected right  
    under Article 19(1)(g).
-   Suspension of internet for indefinite period not permissible. It can only be for a reasonable  
    duration and periodic review should be done. Government should publish all orders of  
    prohibition to enable affected persons to challenge the same.

**On Section 144 of CrPC:**

-   The power under Section 144, cannot be used to suppress legitimate expression of opinion  
    or grievance or exercise of any democratic rights
-   When Sec 144 is imposed for reasons of apprehended danger, that danger must be an  
    “emergency”.
-   The imposition of Sec 144 must strike a balance between the rights of the individual and  
    the concerns of the state.
-   Powers under Sec 144 should be exercised in a reasonable and bona fide manner, and the  
    order must state material facts in order to enable judicial review.

**Conclusion**

-   Expression through the Internet has gained contemporary relevance and is one of the major  
    means of information diffusion. **Before completing blocking the Internet, it is essential to**  
    **conduct a proportionality and necessity test**. It is crucial to consider whether the same  
    objective can be achieved by a less intrusive and more effective solution such as  
    deployment of the police force and running advisories on media.
-   At the same time, **in the interest of transparency, government should document the**  
    **reasons, time, alternatives considered, decision-making authorities and the rules** under  
    which the shutdowns were imposed and release the documents for public scrutiny.

Other restrictions are found in 19(3), which are as follows:

-   Sovereignty and integrity of India
-   Public Order

Lucknow bench of Allahabad HC in 2013 has banned caste rallies on the ground that they  
disturb public order and creates animosity between castes. This order is being contested as it  
seems to violate Art. 19(1)(b).

#### 6.8.9.10. Right to strike in case of Govt. Officials

Trade Unions have the right to strike under certain circumstances in Industrial Disputes Act.

However, for the government officials, SC has held that right to strike is available only as a last  
resort, when all other channels of communication have failed. However, it can not be deemed  
to be coming under the cover of Fundamental Rights. Hence, the government can invoke  
Essential Services Maintenance Act in such situations and force to call off the strike.

SC in T.K. Rangarajan vs. State of Tamil Nadu held that govt. officials don’t have the fundamental  
right to strike.

### 6.9. Article 20- Protection in respect of Conviction for Offences

#### 6.9.1. Text

Protection in respect of conviction for offences.

1.  No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time  
    of the commission of the Act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater  
    than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the  
    commission of the offence.
2.  No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once.
3.  No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.

#### 6.9.2. Description

Article 20(1) guarantees rights against ex-post facto laws. Only a law in force at the time of  
commission of the said offence can be used to punish an accused. However, such a protection is  
available only in case of criminal laws and not civil laws.

Article 20(2) provides protection from double jeopardy. It states that an individual can be  
punished for an offence only once. Departmental inquiries are however not treated as violation  
of this principle.

Article 20(3) protects an individual from self-incrimination. Every person has the right to defend  
himself. In Selvi vs. State of Karnataka SC has put restrictions on narco analysis and brain  
mapping. However, DNA testing and other samples can be taken.

partly to override the Supreme Courts’ ruling favoring Vodafone in a tax dispute. Notably, the  
government could bring in such an amendment because it was a tax law, not a criminal law.

### 6.10. Article 21 – Right to Life and Liberty

#### 6.10.1. Text

_Protection of life and personal liberty._

_No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure  
established by law._

#### 6.10.2. Description

This article is a check on arbitrary powers of the State. The State must act according to a  
procedure while depriving an individual of his liberty.

Procedure established by law has been borrowed from the British tradition. It checks whether  
the law is procedurally correct. However, judiciary is not allowed to challenge the intentions of  
the law.

Due process of law is a facet of American judiciary. Judiciary can challenge the law not only on  
procedural grounds but also on the basis of its reasonableness.

#### 6.10.3. Due Process of Law

It implies that law has to be fair and reasonable. If it is not, then it is liable to be struck down  
even if the prescribed procedure is followed. It is also known as Principle of Natural justice. The  
constitutional guarantee of due process of law, found in fifth and fourteenth amendment to the  
US Constitution, prohibits all levels of government from arbitrarily or unfairly depriving  
individuals of their basic constitutional rights to life, liberty and property. It is because of this  
principle that the Supreme Court of USA has acquired more powers than Apex Courts in other  
countries, including India.

#### 6.10.4. Status in India

#### 6.10.4. 1. Maneka Gandhi case (1978)

Supreme Court accepted that due process is inherent in procedure established by law. SC in this  
case applied the American principle of “due process of law” for the first time. It applied the  
following arguments:

-   Article 19 and 21 can’t be understood as watertight compartments and the same criteria of  
    reasonableness must be applied for Article 21 too.
-   Merely following the procedure established by law is not enough. The courts have the right  
    to review and question the reasonableness of the law itself.
-   Restrictions must be reasonable, just and fair and shouldn’t be arbitrary.

In India, traditionally we followed the principle of “procedure established by law”, as it  
prevailed in Britain. However since 1978, we have followed both in India.

The Supreme Court held that due process of law is not available in India. Hence, it implied that

suicide and death. Thus section 309 of IPC, which criminalizes attempt to suicide doesn’t violate  
Article 21.

#### 6.10. 7. Death Penalty/Capital Punishment

While global trend is in favor of abolishment of death penalty, India continues to find itself in  
mix of countries such as China, Iran, Pakistan, USA where it has not been completely abolished.

The proponents of death penalty hail it for its deterrent capacity. Further, there are some  
crimes, which are so heinous that nothing short of death penalty meets the ends of justice. In  
cases like terrorism, if terrorists are not executed then they continue to pose a grave threat to  
national security.

However following arguments are made in favor of abolishing death penalty.

-   No sufficient data to support the deterrent logic.
-   Study conducted in USA shows that the state abolishing death penalty had witnessed the  
    fall in murders.
-   The principle of revenge (eye for an eye) cannot be the basis of justice in any civilized  
    society
-   The purpose of punishment should be to reform rather than to punish
-   In Bachan Singh case, the Supreme Court sought to strike a balance. It proclaimed that  
    death penalty is an exception not a rule. It proclaimed the doctrine of “rarest of the rare”.
-   There is also possibility of error in judgment as admitted by the SC in 2009 in “Santosh  
    Kumar v/s State of Maharastra case”. It admitted that there are at least 13 cases in which  
    death penalty was awarded, the doctrine of “rarest of the rare” was not applied. Out of  
    these, 2 persons have already been executed.
-   United Nation’s Declaration on Human Rights also expects the state to abolish torturous  
    punishments and death penalty.

It is argued that for heinous crimes such as rape and murder, life imprisonment can be a better  
option.

#### 6.10.8. Right to Privacy

In Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (retd.) vs Union of India (2017), a nine-judge Constitution Bench of  
the Supreme Court ruled that right to privacy is an intrinsic part of life and liberty under Article

21.  However, the court held that privacy is not an absolute right.

Student Notes:
```

The government can introduce a law which “intrudes” into privacy for public and legitimate  
state reasons. Legitimate aims of the state would include for instance protecting national  
security, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging innovation and the spread of  
knowledge and preventing the dissipation of social welfare benefits. But a person can challenge  
this law in country’s constitutional courts for violation of his fundamental right to privacy.

#### 6.10. 9. Euthanasia/Mercy killing

Aruna Shaunbag case, SC permitted passive euthanasia but not active euthanasia.

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

#### 6.10.9.1. Active Euthanasia Student Notes:^

Means ending the life of a person by giving him active means like lethal injections, drugs etc.

#### 6.10.9.2. Passive Euthanasia

Means taking out the life support systems. It is allowed by SC to be done under guarded  
circumstances only.

In March, 2018, Supreme Court ruled that the **right to die with dignity** is a fundamental right,  
saying that an individual could make an advance "living will" that would authorize passive  
euthanasia under certain circumstances. The Court held that passive euthanasia and living will  
were legally valid.

#### 6.10.9.3. Living Will

Living will is a written document that allows a patient to give explicit instructions in advance  
about the medical treatment to be administered when he or she is terminally-ill or no longer  
able to express informed consent.

#### 6.10. 9. 4. Guarded Circumstances

Once request for mercy killing is made by the patient or close relatives, the case is considered  
by a committee of HC judges of at least two members. This committee will make  
recommendation on the basis of opinion of three-member committee of doctors.

#### 6.10. 10. Right to choose

Right to Choose guarantees individuals the right to personal autonomy, which means that a  
person's decisions regarding his or her personal life are respected so long as he/she is not a  
nuisance to society. However, higher judiciary has taken differing opinions on this right.

-   Supreme Court in **_Hadiya Case_** _in 2018_ held that a person's right to choose a religion and  
    marry is an intrinsic part of a person’s meaningful existence. Neither the State nor  
    “patriarchal supremacy” can interfere in his/her decision. Freedom of faith is essential to  
    his/her autonomy; choosing a faith is the substratum of individuality and sans it, the right  
    of choice becomes a shadow, The Constitution guarantees to each individual the right freely  
    to practise, profess and propagate religion. Choices of faith and belief as indeed choices in  
    matters of marriage lie within an area where individual autonomy is supreme.
-   Patna High Court in _the_ **_Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies v State of_**  
    **_Bihar (2016_** _)_ held the imposition of “prohibition” in Bihar as unconstitutional. It addressed  
    the question of imposition of prohibition in terms of its impact on the right to life and  
    liberty of a citizen. Supreme Court, however, has stayed the operation of the Patna High  
    Court judgment.
-   Bombay High Court in **_High Court on Its Own Motion v State of Maharashtra_** **(2016),** read  
    in “choice” as a ground on which a woman may lawfully seek an abortion, even though the  
    Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 only permits abortions on the ground that the  
    pregnancy might affect the mental health of the woman.
-   Bombay High Court, in **Shaikh Zahid Mukhtiar v State of Maharashtra (2016),** struck down  
    the sections of Maharashtra Animal Preservation Act, 1976, on the grounds that it is a  
    breach of Article 21, specifically the right to consume food of one’s choice in private.
-   Supreme Court overturned Delhi High Court’s judgment decriminalizing voluntary  
    homosexual acts on the premise (among other things) that it was a violation of the right to  
    privacy of the individual, which is part of the right to life of a person ( **_Suresh Kumar Koushal_**  
    **_v Naz Foundation_** **(2014)** ). It refused to even engage in the argument that LGBTQ persons  
    may have rights.

### 6.11. Article 21A Student Notes:^

#### 6.11.1. Text of Right to education

_The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to  
fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine._

#### 6.11.2. Description/Historical Evolution

In 1992, the Supreme Court held in Mohini Jain case that the “right to education” is part of  
“right to life” and hence is a fundamental right under Part III of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court Judgment in Unni Krishnan case further reinforced the same when it  
affirmed that right to education flows from the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 and  
draws its support from the Directive Principles of the Constitution, Article 41 and 45.

Article 41 provides for right to education. Article 45 originally required the State to make  
provisions within 10 years for free and compulsory education for all children until they achieved  
the age of 14 years. It has been replaced by 86th Amendment Act.

Notably, SC held that this too is not an absolute right. It shall depend on the state to determine  
the manner in which it shall implement the right.

The demand for RTE was first made by Gopal Krishna Gokhale during British times. After 100  
years of this, RTE came into existence.

#### 6.11.3. 86th Amendment Act

The 86th Amendment Act brought about the following changes to the Constitution:

-   Under Article 21A, every child between the age of 6-14 has a fundamental right to  
    education, which the State shall provide “in such a manner the State may, by law,  
    determine”
-   Early childhood care and protection (for children in the age group of 0-6) is provided for as  
    a directive principle of State Policy under Article 45 of the Constitution.
-   Article 51 (K) provides a duty on those who are parent or guardian, to provide opportunities  
    for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age 8-14.

#### 6.11. 4. Evaluation of RTE

-   There are no specific penalties if the authorities fail to provide the right to elementary  
    education.
-   Both the state government and the local authority have the duty to provide free and  
    compulsory elementary education. Sharing of this duty may lead to neither government  
    being held accountable.
-   The Bill provides for the right to schooling and physical infrastructure but does not  
    guarantee that children learn. It exempts government schools from any consequences if  
    they do not meet the specified norms.
-   The Bill legitimizes the practice of multi-grade teaching. The number of teachers shall be  
    based on the number of students rather than by grade.
-   Enrolment has reached universal levels but the problem of dropouts and absenteeism  
    continues
-   Also, the act doesn’t provide for those who cannot go to school
-   Hence, it is said that it is a right to schooling instead of the right to education

Applies to all children in the relevant age group whether Indian citizens or not.

### 6.12. Article 22- Protection against Arrest and Detention in Certain

### Cases

#### 6.12.1. Text

Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases.

1.  No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as  
    may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be  
    defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.
2.  Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest  
    magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary  
    for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person  
    shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate.
3.  Nothing in clauses (1) and (2) shall apply—  
    a) to any person who for the time being is an enemy alien; or  
    b) to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive  
    detention.
4.  No law providing for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a person for a  
    longer period than three months unless—  
    a) an Advisory Board consisting of persons who are, or have been, or are qualified to be  
    appointed as, Judges of a High Court has reported before the expiration of the said  
    period of three months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention:  
    Provided that nothing in this sub-clause shall authorise the detention of any person  
    beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament under sub-  
    clause (b) of clause (7); or  
    b) such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by  
    Parliament under sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7).
5.  When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for  
    preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be,  
    communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall  
    afford him the earliest opportunity of making a (b) to any person who is arrested or  
    detained under any law providing for preventive detention.
6.  Nothing in clause (5) shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in  
    that clause to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest  
    to disclose.

#### 6.12.2. Description

Article 22 provides for 2 kinds of detentions-

-   Preventive detention; and
-   Punitive detention

Protection in case of punitive detention is available to citizens and no-citizens but not to enemy  
aliens. A person must be informed of the grounds of his arrest so that he can prepare for his  
defense. The person also has the right to consult and be defended by the legal practitioner of  
his choice. Such an individual must be presented before a magistrate within 24 hours so that  
any wrong action of the executive can be corrected.

The objective of preventive detention is to prevent a person from committing a crime. Certain Student Notes:  
rights are available to such a person as well. He must be informed of the grounds of his arrest.  
Police cannot detain a person beyond 3 months unless it has permission from an advisory board.  
Such an advisor board will consist of 3 judges of SC. Parliament can also prescribe a law  
providing for detention beyond 3 months.

#### 6.12.2.1. Criticism of Preventive Detention

In India, there has been a misuse of such laws and so it has become a human rights concern. It  
represents the police power of the State. No other democratic country mentions preventive  
detention in its constitution and such laws come into effect only under emergency conditions.

#### 6.12.2.2. Arguments given in favor of Preventive detention

Areas in context of which preventive laws can be made are laid down in the Constitution itself  
in Union List entry 9 related to defense, foreign affairs and security of the country and  
Concurrent List entry 3 for maintenance of public order, security of state and maintaining  
essential supply and services. Thus, it checks the arbitrary action by the State.

#### 6.12.3. Legislations

The below mentioned acts have a provision to detain beyond three months:

-   National Security Act,
-   Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Act (COFEPOSA); and
-   Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA)Likewise, many states have come up with similar acts.  
    Both at the central and state level, there are around forty laws in the statute book of India  
    authorizing preventive detention.

#### 6.12.4. Court Judgments

-   In case of arrest of Anna Hazare in 2011, SC held that preventive detention law can be  
    invoked only if there is "imminent danger to peace" and a person sought to be arrested is  
    likely to commit a cognisable offence. Otherwise it would violate the victim's fundamental  
    right.
-   In another judgment, SC held that rhetorical incantation of word “goonda” or “prejudicial to  
    maintenance of public order” cannot be sufficient justification to invoke the draconian  
    powers of preventive detention. It quashed preventive detention of a man who was  
    accused of selling spurious chilli seeds to farmers. It observed that when sufficient  
    remedies for offence were available under ordinary laws, preventive detention must not be  
    invoked. It cannot be an alternative to normal legal process. Order of preventive detention  
    affects the life and liberty of citizen under Articles 14, 19, 21 and 22 and hence should be  
    used cautiously. It came down heavily on the practice of states to use preventive detention  
    laws to avoid efforts in investigation and prosecution.

### 6.13. Article 23 – Prohibition of Traffic in Humans and Forced

### Labor

#### 6.1 3. 1. Text

Prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labor.

1.  Traffic in human beings and begar and other similar forms of forced labor are prohibited  
    and any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in accordance with  
    law.
2.  Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from imposing compulsory service for public  
    purposes, and in imposing such service the State shall not make any discrimination on  
    grounds only of religion, race, caste or class or any of them.

#### 6.1 5. 3 .1. Jagadishwaranand case, 1984

The Supreme Court held that the Anand Margi practice of dancing with skulls is not essential to  
its religion and could be reasonably restricted. Similarly, cow slaughter is not considered  
essential to Islam on Bakrid Day. Thus, the state can regulate what constitutes the essential  
religious practices and what does not and outlaw the latter if it is anti-social.

#### 6.1 5. 3 .2. Stainislau v/s State of MP, 1977

Constitution bench of the Supreme Court ruled that Article 25(1) doesn’t give the right to  
convert but only the right to spread tenets of one’s own religion.

Thus, only voluntary conversions are valid in India. In fact, some states have passed anti-  
conversion laws prohibiting forced conversions.

### 6.1 6. Article 26 Student Notes:^

#### 6.1 6 .1. Text

Freedom to manage religious affairs—subject to public order, morality and health, every  
religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the right—

a) to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes;  
b) to manage its own affairs in matters of religion;  
c) to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and  
d) to administer such property in accordance with law.

#### 6.1 6 .2. Description

Article 26 states that a religion has a right to

-   Establish and maintain its institutions for religious and charitable purposes,
-   Manage its own affairs and
-   Acquire property for the same.
-   The State can make laws to regulate the administration of such property, but it cannot take  
    away the right to administration altogether.

This freedom is, however, subject to **public order, morality** and **health**.

**_Note-_** _The “_ **_religious denomination_** _” must satisfy three conditions. It must be a collection of  
individuals who has a system of beliefs or doctrine which they regard as conducive to their  
spiritual well-being. These include a_ **_common faith, common organisation_** _and_ **_designation by a  
distinctive name._**

**_Note_** _– while right to property of an individual is not a Fundamental Right anymore, for religious  
denomination it continues to be a Fundamental Right._

**_Note_** _: In a January 2014 verdict the Supreme Court quashed the Tamil Nadu government's order  
appointing executive officer to manage the affairs and properties of the ancient Sri  
Sabhanayagar Temple, better known as Nataraja temple, in Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu. The  
SC Bench held that the temple will be managed by priests and cannot be taken over by the state  
government over allegations of mismanagement of temple properties._

#### 6.1 6 .3. Relation with Article 25

Article 25 gives freedom to an individual, while Article 26 deals with an entire religious  
denomination or any of its section.

#### 6.1 6 .4. Sabarimala Temple Issue

Recently, the Supreme Court has deferred its decision on review of “2018 Sabarimala verdict”  
until a Seven Judges’ Bench examines broader issues such as essentiality of religious practices  
and constitutional morality.

**Background of the issue**

-   Sabarimala temple’s age-old practice **barred** women in their reproductive phases (when  
    they were at the menstruating phase) from entering the temple on the ground that the  
    **presiding deity** was a complete celibate.
-   In the “ **Indian Young Lawyers Association & Others vs The State of Kerala & Others”** case,  
    2018, a five- judge bench had delivered a landmark 4:1 ruling setting aside the decades-old  
    restrictions on the entry of women of reproductive age inside Sabarimala Temple.  
    o The judgment remarked that ban on the entry of women in Sabarimala is **a kind of**  
    **untouchability** , and thus violative of Article 17.

Student Notes:

```
Constitutional Morality
```

-   The term ‘morality’ or ‘constitutional morality’ has not  
    been defined in the Constitution.
-   As per the Supreme Court, the **magnitude and sweep**  
    of **constitutional morality** is not confined to the  
    provisions and literal text which a Constitution  
    contains, rather it embraces within itself virtues of a  
    **wide magnitude** such as that of ushering a pluralistic  
    and inclusive society, while adhering to the other  
    principles of constitutionalism.
-   In the 2018 Sabarimala verdict, the majority opinion  
    defined ‘ **morality’** in **Article 25** to mean **constitutional**  
    **morality**.  
    o Article 25 reads, “Subject to public order, morality  
    and health and to the other provisions of this Part,  
    all persons are equally entitled to freedom of  
    conscience and the right freely to profess, practise  
    and propagate religion”.
-   As per the Supreme Court, “when there is a violation of  
    the fundamental rights, the term ‘ **morality’** naturally  
    implies **constitutional morality** and any view taken by  
    the courts, must be in conformity with the principles  
    and basic tenets of the concept of Constitutional  
    morality.”

```
o However, Sabrimala Temple Board h ad argued that these were matters of “faith”,
“belief” and cannot be termed as regressive, anti-women and had therefore urged the
court not to interfere with the practice
o Justice Indu Malhotra also had dissented against the majority verdict on the ground
that courts should not sit on judgement over harmless religious beliefs unless they
were pernicious practices such as sati.
```

-   Recently, review pleas were filed against above order. The petitioners contended that the  
    2018 judgments suffered from an error apparent since **constitutional morality is a vague**  
    **concept** which cannot be utilised to undermine belief and faith.
-   However, the court did not stay its earlier verdict which allowed women between the ages  
    of 10 and 50 to visit Sabarimala temple.
-   Now, the larger Bench would also consider the entry of women into mosques and the  
    practice of female genital mutilation, prevalent among the Dawoodi Bohras Sect.

**Implications of the Supreme Court’s fresh examination of the Sabarimala Cas** e

-   **Will raise various key Constitutional questions** : The seven-judges’ Bench will examine:  
    o Question of balancing the freedom of religion under Articles 25 and 26 of the  
    Constitution with other fundamental rights, particularly the Right to equality (Article  
    14).  
    o Should “ **essential religious practices** ” or the “doctrine of essentiality” be accorded  
    constitutional protection under Article 26 (freedom to manage religious affairs)?  
    o What is the “permissible  
    extent” of judicial  
    recognition a court should  
    give to PILs filed by people  
    who do not belong to the  
    religion of which practices  
    are under the scanner?  
    o Whether a court can probe  
    whether a practice is  
    essential to a religion or  
    should the question be left  
    to the respective religious  
    head?
-   The **constitutional debate on**  
    **gender equality** will be  
    reopened with the larger issue  
    of whether any religion can bar  
    women from entering places of  
    worship.

**Understanding Doctrine of  
Essentiality and related debates**

-   **Doctrine of essentiality:** The  
    doctrine of “essentiality” was invented by a seven-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in the  
    ‘Shirur Mutt’ case in 1954 in which the court held that the term “religion” will cover all  
    rituals and practices “integral” to a religion, and took upon itself the responsibility of  
    determining the essential and non-essential practices of a religion.
-   **Surrounding debates** :  
    o **Essentiality vs right to freedom of religion** : The Supreme Court in ‘Ratilal Gandhi vs the  
    State of Bombay’ (1954) acknowledged that “every person has a fundamental right to

entertain such religious beliefs as may be approved by his judgment or conscience”. Student Notes:
However, the Essentiality test impinges on this autonomy.
▪ The apex court has itself emphasised autonomy and choice in its Privacy (2017),
377 (2018), and Adultery (2018) judgments.
o Issue of Judicial overreach: The doctrine has been criticised by several constitutional
experts as it has tended to lead the court into an area that is beyond its competence,
and given judges the power to decide purely religious questions which should be
decided by the theologians.
```

-   **Issues with the conception** : The concept of providing constitutional protection only to  
    those elements of religion, which courts consider “essential” is problematic. Such an  
    approach assumes that one element or practice of religion is independent of the others.
-   **Arbitrariness in its application** : Over the years, courts have been inconsistent on this  
    question — in some cases they have relied on religious texts to determine essentiality, in  
    others on the empirical behaviour of followers, and in yet others, based on whether the  
    practice existed at the time the religion originated.
-   **Group rights vs Individual Rights:** The Supreme Court has itself acknowledged that “every  
    individual has a fundamental right to entertain such religious beliefs”. However, the  
    essential practices test is antithetical to the individualistic conception of rights. Under the  
    test, the court privileges certain religious practices over others, thus protecting the group’s  
    rights.

Thus, there should be a balance in terms of determining religious freedom as well as  
constitutional morality while dealing under Article 26.

### 6.1 7. Article 27

#### 6.1 7 .1. Text

_Freedom as to payment of taxes for promotion of any particular religion.—No person shall be  
compelled to pay any taxes, the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated in payment of  
expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination._

#### 6.1 7 .2. Description

Article 27 prohibits the State from spending any public money collected by way of tax for  
promotion of any religion. It is one of the essential consequences of secularism. The State  
cannot patronize any particular religion or religious denomination. In other words, the state  
should not spend the public money collected by way of tax for the promotion or maintenance  
of any particular religion. This provision prohibits the state from favoring, patronizing and  
supporting one religion over the other. This means that the taxes can be used for the promotion  
or maintenance of all religions.

This provision prohibits only levy of a tax and not a fee. This is because the purpose of a fee is  
to control secular administration of religious institutions and not to promote or maintain  
religion. Thus a fee can be levied on pilgrims to provide them some special service or safety  
measures. Similarly, a fee can be levied on religious endowments for meeting the regulation  
expenditure.

**Note:** In 2012, the Supreme Court directed the Union government to gradually reduce and  
abolish Haj subsidy in 10 years and invest the amount in education and other measures for  
social development of the minority community.

    imparted in such institution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in  
    such institution or in any premises attached thereto unless such person or, if such person is  
    a minor, his guardian has given his consent thereto.

#### 6.1 8 .2. Description

According to Article 28,

-   No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained  
    out of State funds.
-   However, this provision does not apply to institutions administered by the state but  
    established under any endowment or trust, which requires imparting religious instructions.

#### 6.1 9 .1. Text

Protection of interests of minorities.

1.  Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a  
    distinct language, script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same.
2.  No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the  
    State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or  
    any of them.

#### 6.1 9 .2. Description

Article 29(1) recognizes the right of an individual to preserve his culture, his language and script.  
Article 29(2) prohibits the State from making discrimination while granting access to  
educational institutions.

Note: Article 15 doesn’t mention language as a ground of discrimination, but it is included in  
Article 29.

Article 29 grants protection to both linguistic and religious minorities. SC has held that the  
scope of this article is not restricted to minorities only and is available to “all sections” of the  
population, including majority.

In Champakam Dorairajan case (1951) the reservation provided to backward sections was  
challenged on the ground that it violated Article 29(2). The 1st Amendment Act was then  
enacted, inserting Article 15(4) for providing reservation.

#### 6.1 9 .3. Applicability

Both article 29 and 30 are available to Indian citizens only.

Right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions.

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

**1)** All minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and Student Notes:  
administer educational institutions of their choice.  
**a)** In making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an  
educational institution established and administered by a minority, referred to in clause  
(1), the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for  
the acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right  
guaranteed under that clause.  
**2)** The State shall not, in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against any  
educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority,  
whether based on religion or language.

#### 6\. 20 .2. Description

Under Article 30, minorities (linguistic or religious) have the right to establish and administer  
educational institutions of their choice. The State cannot impose any restrictions on the right of  
the minorities except for making regulations, which promote excellence in education.

In case a minority’s property is acquired by the State, it shall be provided adequate  
compensation for the same.

The State cannot discriminate while providing aid to such institutions.

The term minority has not been defined by the Constitution but literally it means a non-  
dominant group.

In Presidential reference to Kerala Education Bill, and later on Guru Nanak Dev University, the  
judiciary has established parameters to determine the minority status. At union level, it means  
those groups, which have less than 50% population at all India level. At state level, it means  
groups forming less than 50% population within the state.

#### 6\. 20 .3. Relation between Article 29 and 30

While Article 29 is a general protection available to all sections of the population, Article 30 is  
protection available only to the linguistic or religious minorities.

#### 6\. 20 .4. Applicability

Articles 29 and 30, both, are available to Indian citizens only.

#### 6\. 20. 5. Minority Educational Institutions

**What are minority educational institutions (MEIs)?**

These are the institutions established to protect and promote the unique culture and traditions  
of minority groups. The minority groups can either be linguistic or religious.

**What are the criteria?**

-   The NCMEI has issued a set of guidelines for the determination of minority status of  
    educational institutions under Article 30.
-   Effectively, there are two conditions that a school must fulfill in order to obtain minority  
    status:  
    o Most of Board or trust members must belong to the minority community.  
    o It must declare explicitly that it has been established for the benefit of the minority  
    community.
-   The state authorities have prescribed similar criteria.

Student Notes:
```

**Recent controversies**

-   In 2016 the Central government has filed a fresh affidavit in SC saying a Central University,  
    cannot be granted minority status.
-   SC was hearing an appeal against Allahabad high court Judgement 2006 in which the  
    minority status accorded to Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) was revoked.
-   The Law Ministry has recommended revoking the 2011 order of NCMEI declaring Jamia  
    Millia Islamia as a religious minority institution on the same ground.

**Why Provision of minority status should be retained?**

-   Art 26(a) states that religious denominations can establish institutions for religious and  
    charitable purposes. AMU and JMIU has been instrumental in bringing social change in  
    minority community by providing education to Muslim youth which can be considered as  
    charitable work under art 26 (a).
-   Art 38 mandates the state to reduce inequalities among different section of society and  
    such MEIs AMU and JMIU act as an agent of change among minority in providing quality  
    and formal education
-   InAzeez Basha case, 1967SC ruled that universities come under the definition of  
    “educational institution” in Article 30(1). Thus, in a way, it also made obligatory on  
    government to recognize such MEIs through statute.
-   In Kerala Education bill case SC restricted the power of state in revoking minority status and  
    depriving the minority from establishing and managing such institutions.

Why it should be revoked? Student Notes:
```

-   A university cannot be conferred Minority status because it can be incorporated only by act  
    of Parliament. Since AMU and JMIU are established through a statute, these institutions  
    cannot be considered as MEIs
-   Universities receiving direct funding from states cannot be accorded minority status as this  
    is in direct conflict with Art 27 which says that no proceeds of any taxes shall be utilized for  
    promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination.
-   Universities established under parliament act has to follow the reservation policy of central  
    government but AMU and JMIU do not provide any reservation to Scheduled Castes,  
    Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. Hence the minority tag provided to such  
    institutions is unconstitutional and illegal.
-   Article 15 of the Constitution prohibits discrimination by state on grounds of religion and  
    conferring minority status to any institution set up by a parliament or state would be in  
    contravention.
-   In Azeez Basha case, 1967 case, the SC upheld that AMU was not a minority educational  
    institution as it was set up by British legislature, and not by Muslims.
-   The right under Article 30(1) is not an absolute right and it seems to be in contradiction to  
    Article 29(2), which prohibits denial of admission to any citizen into any educational  
    institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of  
    religion, race, caste, language or any of them.”

**Privileges accorded under Minority status**

-   Article 30 provides that in case of compulsory takeover of property by state, due  
    compensation must be provided to institution.
-   MEIs are out of purview of reservation policy under Art 15. Recently, Bombay High Court  
    came to the aid of MEIs and held that they need not reserve seats for backward class  
    students.
-   Sect 12 of Right to Education Act (RTE) 2009, which mandates 25% reservation for children  
    belonging to economically weaker section (EWS), is also not applicable on MEI.
-   In TMA Pai vs State of Karnataka 2002 case  
    o SC allowed MEIs to have separate, fair, and transparent and merit-based admission  
    process.  
    o They can also have separate fee structure but not allowed to charge capitation fee.

**Challenges faced by MEIs**

-   MEIs hardly have any substantial autonomy asthey receive funds from the government. For  
    e.g. while the president of India can nullify any decision of these universities, he has no  
    such power in respect of private universities.
-   The real issue is the maladministration of minority institutions. Many private unaided  
    minority institutions are in a mess and suffering from mismanagement, corruption etc. For  
    e.g. selling minority seats to non- minority candidates.
-   Exemption from RTE act obligations has led to rent-seeking behaviour among schools.  
    Poorer sections among minority groups are not able to take admission in such institutions  
    which render the purpose of establishing such institutions defeated.
-   National level Entrance exams like National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET) and common  
    counselling have now virtually taken away the minority institutions’ right to admit students  
    of their choice.
-   Many Schools have resorted to acquire fake minority certificate to avoid obligations under  
    RTE act 2009.

Way forward Student Notes:
```

-   The minority status should not be revoked due to mere technical lacunae. After all  
    Minorities invest their resources, properties and time and also educate 50% non-minorities  
    in their institutions.
-   The ambiguities and gaps in the current administrative setup must be removed so that  
    minority status’ is not hijacked for private interests at the expense of minority welfare and  
    equitable education
-   More autonomy must be given to such universities in curriculum design and operation.
-   The court has consistently maintained that the receipt of governmental aid does not mean  
    the surrender of minority character. Hence Government may provide funding to MEIs in  
    tune with other universities.
-   The Supreme Court’s decision to exempt all minority schools from the RTE need to be  
    reviewed.
-   The separate criteria for linguistic minorities must be evolved as criteria formulated by the  
    NCMEI for religious minorities cannot be applied indiscriminately on linguistic minorities.  
    For e.g. the medium of instruction in the linguistic minority institution must be in its  
    language. At present, only Maharashtra has such a requirement.

#### 6\. 20. 6. Important judgments

#### 6\. 20. 6 .1. St. Stephens v/s University of Delhi, 1992

The Supreme Court ruled that minority institutions should make available at least 50% of their  
annual admission intake for other communities. The admission of other communities should be  
done purely on the basis of merit.

#### 6\. 20. 6 .2. Unnikrishnan v/s State of Andhra Pradesh, 1993

Supreme Court ordered for the introduction of three types of seats:

-   15% seats are management seats and fee is not limited.
-   35% seats, wherein State government fixed fees
-   50% are free seats based on merit established by a common entrance examination

#### 6\. 20. 6 .3. TMA Pai Foundation and others v/s State of Karnataka, 2002

Following are the essential features of the landmark judgment:

-   All citizens have the rights to establish and administer educational institutions
-   The right to administer MEI (Minority Educational Institution) is not absolute
-   The State can apply regulations to unaided MEIs also to achieve educational excellence
-   Percentage of non-minority students to be admitted to an aided MEI to be decided by the  
    state or university.
-   Fees to be charged by unaided MEIs can’t be regulated, but no institution can charge  
    capitation fee.

#### 6\. 20. 6 .4. Islamic Academy of education v/s State of Karnataka, 2003

In this case, the Supreme Court clarified its judgment in TMA Pai case. The ruling says that  
Article 30 confers on linguistic and religious minorities the unqualified right to establish  
educational institutions, but the government could exercise control and regulation on them for  
maintaining good standards.

#### 6\. 20. 6 .5. St. Joseph College Case, 20 18

Supreme Court in April, 2018 ruled that the National Commission for Minority Educational

to issue a certificate regarding the status of the minority educational institution. Student Notes:

#### 6\. 20. 7. The Lacuna

The issue acquires importance because the Constitution doesn’t define the words “majority”  
and “minority” – a lacuna that has induced many Hindu sects like Arya Samajists, and  
Ramkrishnaites to acquire the status of a minority. It is notable that Hindus are minority in five  
states –Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Nagaland, Mizoram, Meghalaya.

### 6.2 1. Article 31

It was originally the right to property but **was repealed in 1978** by the 44th Amendment Act and  
made into an ordinary right under Article 300A.

**Background**

-   The Constitution originally provided for the **Right to Property** as a fundamental right (F.R.)  
    under Articles 19 and 31.  
    o **Article 19(1) (f)** guaranteed to the Indian citizens a right to acquire, hold and dispose of  
    property.  
    o **Article 31** of Indian Constitution stated that no person can be deprived of his property  
    without the consent of a proper authority.  
    o Also, **Article 31(2** ) had put two limitations on State power of acquisition of land viz.  
    ▪ Firstly, the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of land should be for public  
    purpose.  
    ▪ Secondly, the law enacted in that behalf should provide for compensation.  
    o However, after independence, it resulted in numerous litigations between the  
    government and citizens. Major contentious issues were:  
    ▪ Laws enacted by government in relation to land reform measures to provide  
    housing to the people in the urban area  
    ▪ Regulation of private enterprises  
    ▪ Nationalization of some commercial undertakings.  
    o To narrow its scope it was modified several times by the constitutional amendments  
    namely **1st, 4th, 17th, 25th and 42nd Constitutional Amendment Acts**.  
    o However, it was continued to be seen as a roadblock in socio-economic development of  
    the country.  
    o Finally, **44th Constitutional Amendment Act** repealed the entire Article 31 and Article  
    19(1)(f) & inserted Article 300A.

**Right to Property under Article 300A**

-   **Article 300-A** states that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of  
    law. This means that-  
    o Property is no longer a Fundamental Right, i.e. the aggrieved individual would not be  
    competent to move to Supreme Court under Article 32, for any violation of Art 300A.  
    o Also, a law will be necessary to deprive a person of his property.
-   One can’t move to the Supreme Court or High Court in case this right is violated.
-   Further, it protects individuals from arbitrary executive action only, not from arbitrary  
    legislative action.
-   The state is not constitutionally bound to pay any compensation in case of acquisition.

Student Notes:
```

**Arguments in favour of Right to property to be reinstated as Fundamental Right**

-   It **would protect citizens from unwarranted state action in the name of acquisition** :  
    Compulsory land acquisition and mass displacement in the name of development have  
    given rise to certain socio-economic issues. Thus, there is a need of stronger checks on the  
    government.
-   It **will provide support to the judiciary** : As of now the development of the Supreme Court’s  
    doctrinal jurisprudence is only safeguard against the fear of arbitrariness of State action.  
    For example- **The Fair Balance test**.  
    o The elevated status of Right to Property will aid Judiciary for effective delivery of justice.
-   **Tackling manipulative practices in calculating fair compensation** : Land owners are at times  
    deprived of a fair compensation due to vagueness in laws relating to land acquisitions.
-   **Insecure Titles and Poor Land Records and Administration** : Many citizens lack a clear title  
    to their land and it is accompanied by poor maintenance of land records by state  
    organizations. For instance, the land rights of indigenous tribes were not recognized by the  
    state, despite these people living in the land for generations.

**Arguments in favour of Right to property remaining a legal right**

-   **It leads to smoother Land Acquisition** : India is developing country and for this purpose  
    land acquisition should become swifter which is facilitated by Article 300A.
-   It has **eased up judicial burden** : Previously, the judiciary was burdened with litigations  
    related to property rights. However, it has come down significantly.

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   It **aids government in its welfare objectives** : Given the government provides a fair Student Notes:^  
    compensation, land acquisition is necessary for fulfilling welfare purposes such as ensuring  
    road connectivity, making electricity accessible to all etc.

**Right to Property as a Human Right**

-   In several cases, the Supreme Court of India has held that the right to property is not just a statutory  
    right but is also a human right.
-   **Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948** under Section 17(i) and (ii) also recognizes right to  
    property. It states that-  
    o Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others,  
    o No-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.
-   **Significance** :  
    o provides safeguards against arbitrariness of state  
    o gives due importance to property as a tool of self- protection  
    o allows people to be entrepreneurial  
    **Fair Balance Test**  
    According to it taking of property without payment of an amount reasonably related its value would  
    normally constitute a disproportionate interference which could not be considered as justiciable.

**Recent Developments-**

Recently, the Supreme Court has reiterated that forcible dispossession of a person of his private  
property without due process of law is a human right violation.

**Conclusion**

There is a need to balance the right to property with the development of the society and the  
country as a whole. **Few steps that can be taken in this regard are** :

-   Land records should be computerized.
-   There is a need to develop institutions and processes that are easily accessible and provide  
    mechanisms to the people to definitely establish their land titles.
-   Government must follow guidelines prescribed by the Supreme Court whilst calculating fair  
    compensation. LARR Act can be reformed in this regard.
-   Large scale displacements must be avoided. But if necessary, then appropriate  
    rehabilitation must be provided and the compensation should cover the social cost of  
    displacement as well.

### 6.2 2. Article 31A

Article 31A saves 5 categories of laws from being challenged and invalidated on the ground of  
contravention of Fundamental Rights conferred by Article 14 and Article 19. They are related to  
agricultural land reforms, industry and commerce.

Added by 1st Amendment Act, it allows the State to nationalize private property. The idea was  
to give effect to land reforms.

Both Parliament and State Legislatures can make laws. This article, however doesn’t immunize a  
state law unless it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his  
assent.

This article also provides for payment of compensation at market value when the state acquires  
a land held by a person for cultivation below the statutory ceiling limit.

### 6.2 3. Article 31B – Validation of Certain Acts and Regulations

Article 31B protects the laws in the ninth schedule from invalidation on the ground of  
contravention of rights under Article 14 and 19.

danishmanhas23@gmail.com

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

#### 6.2 3 .1. Controversy with respect to IX Schedule Student Notes:^

The Ninth Schedule was created by a Constitution Amendment in 1951 by former Prime  
Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to push land reforms. The basic purpose of the Schedule was to  
abolish zamindari system. However, in recent times it has been misused. Not just land reforms  
laws, the Ninth Schedule today includes several controversial legislation like the 69 per cent  
reservation law of Tamil Nadu, which violates the Apex Court's 50 per cent ceiling on quotas.

Article 31B, which gives blanket protection to all items in the 9th Schedule, is also retrospective  
in nature. So, even if a statute, which has already been declared unconstitutional by a court of  
law is included within the schedule, it is deemed to be constitutional from the date of its  
inception.

However, in IR Coehlo case (2007), the Apex Court ruled that laws placed under Ninth Schedule  
after April 24, 1973 (the date of Kesavananda Bharati verdict) shall be open to challenge in  
court if they violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 19, 20 and 21 of the  
Constitution. The apex court also said that if the law put in the Ninth Schedule abridges or  
abrogates fundamental rights resulting in the violation of the basic structure of the Constitution,  
such laws have to be invalidated.

### 6.2 4. Article 31C- Saving of laws giving effect to directive principles

Article 31C was inserted by the 25th Amendment Act in 1971 and protects laws implementing  
Directive Principles under 39(b), 39(c) from invalidation on the ground of violation of Article 14,  
19 and 31.

Article 31-C had two parts. The first part protected a law giving effect to the policy of the state  
towards securing the principles specified in Articles 39 (b) and (c) from being challenged on the  
ground of infringement of the Fundamental Rights under Article 14, 19 and 31. The second part  
of Article 31 C originally sought to oust the jurisdiction of the courts to find out whether the law  
in question gave effect to the principles of Articles 39 (b) and 39 (c).

The second part was struck down in the Kesavananda Bharati case 1973, as it took away the  
powers of judicial review, which was held to be a basic feature of the constitution by the  
Supreme Court.

The scope of this Article was further extended through 42nd Amendment Act, in which the  
immunity was provided in favor of all the DPSPs against any of the fundamental rights. It  
provided that no law which gives effect to any of the directive principles (not just 39(b) and  
39(C)) can be invalidated on the ground of violation of the Article 14 and 19.

However, the Apex Court in the Minerva Mill case, 1980 struck down the above provision and  
thereby restored the balance between fundamental rights and directive principles.

-   Adopted from the USA social interest litigation.
-   It’s not private interest litigation, nor a political interest litigation
-   It is not a fundamental right

**(Please** **_refer to PIL portion in the document on Supreme Court for more information_** **)**

#### 6.2 5 .2.2. Epistolary jurisdiction

-   Taking action on the basis of post card, letter.

#### 6.2 5 .2.3. Suo moto

-   SC can take action on its own

#### 6.2 5 .3. Doctrine of Laches

-   SC protects the rights of those who are vigilant about their rights.
-   In case of unnecessary delay in approaching the courts for enforcing the rights, SC may  
    deny the issue of writs.

#### 6.2 5 .4. Doctrine of Res Judicata

-   According to the dictionary meaning, 'res judicata' means a case or suit involving a  
    particular issue between two or more parties already decided by a court. Thereafter, if  
    either of the parties approaches the same court for the adjudication of the same issue, the  
    suit will be struck by the law of 'res judicata'.
-   If a person goes first to a High Court under Article 226 and his petition is dismissed on  
    merits, he cannot approach the SC under Article 32 because of 'res judicata'. He can reach  
    the SC only by way of appeal. If, however, high court dismisses his or her writ petition not  
    on merits, then 'res judicata' does not apply and petitioner can move the SC
-   This doctrine is applied to give recognition to the decision of courts of competent  
    jurisdiction.
-   Same person however, can approach the SC on the same cases, if some new facts have  
    emerged which have not been examined by HC.

#### 6.2 5. 5. Writs Student Notes:^

The Constitution allows the Parliament to empower any other court to issue these writs.  
However, the no such provision has been made so far. Thus, the **Supreme Court** (under Article

32.  and the H **igh** C **ourts** (under Article 226) can issue **all** the **above** writs, and not any other  
    court.

Before 1950, only the High Courts of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras had the power to issue the  
writs. Article 226 now empowers all the high courts to issue the writs.

#### 6.2 5. 5. 1 Difference between writ jurisdiction of SC and HC Student Notes:^

The Supreme Court can issue writs **only for the enforcement of fundamental rights** whereas a  
high court can issue writs not only for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights **but also for any  
other purpose.** The expression ‘for any other purpose’ refers to the enforcement of an ordinary  
legal right. Thus, the writ **jurisdiction of the High Court is wider than that of Supreme court.**

Also, the Supreme Court can issue writs **against a person or government throughout the  
territory of India** whereas a high court can issue writs against a person residing or against a  
government or authority located within its territorial jurisdiction only or outside its territorial  
jurisdiction, only if the cause of action arises within its territorial jurisdiction.

Further, a remedy under Article 32 is in itself a Fundamental Right and hence, the **Supreme  
Court may not refuse to exercise its writ jurisdiction**. On the other hand, a remedy under  
Article 226 is discretionary and hence, a **high court may refuse to exercise its writ jurisdiction**.  
Hence, the Supreme Court is constituted as a defender and guarantor of the fundamental rights.

#### 6.2 5. 6. Importance of Article 32

Mere declaration of the fundamental right is meaningless until and unless there is an effective  
machinery for enforcement of the fundamental rights. So, a right without a remedy is a  
worthless declaration. The framers of our constitution adopted the special provisions in the  
article 32 which provide remedies to the violated fundamental rights of a citizen. SC in IR  
Coehlo case (2007), mentioned that Article 32 is integral part of the basic structure. This article  
also established SC as the guardian of Fundamental Rights. It also shows the SC’s powers of  
judicial review. According to Dr. Ambedkar, this Article is the soul of part-III.

#### 6.2 5. 7. Article 32(3)

Parliament can authorize any other court also to enforce Fundamental Rights.

**Conditions:**

-   Without negatively effecting the powers of SC
-   The other court which has been authorized to issue writs; its powers are limited within the  
    local limits of its jurisdiction.

#### 6.2 5. 8. Article 32(4)

It provides for the suspension of Article 32, in special manner as prescribed in Article 359.

#### 6.2 5. 7 .1.Article 359-Suspension of FRs during the proclamation of national

#### emergency

Except rights given under Article 19, whose enforcement is automatically suspended with the  
proclamation of national emergency on grounds of external aggression or war; the suspension  
of other rights doesn’t happen automatically.

Rights under Article 20 and 21 are never suspended. Rest of the rights can be suspended only  
when the President issues an order to suspend a right. In his order, the President has to specify  
which rights, for what period and for what geographical limits.

discipline among them.

#### 6.2 6 .2. Description

Article 33 empowers the Parliament to restrict or abrogate the application of the fundamental  
rights in relation to the armed forces, paramilitary forces, police etc. But it does not mean that  
the article itself would abrogate any rights. The operation of this article depends upon the  
parliamentary legislation, though these legislations don't need to refer this article. Such  
legislation by parliament of India may restrict the operation of any fundamental rights such as  
Equality, Freedom of Expression, Freedom of association, Personal Liberty etc. One such article  
is Police Forces (Restriction of Rights) Act, 1966. This act was challenged in Supreme Court but  
was held valid.

### 6.2 7. Article 34

#### 6.2 7 .1. Text

Restriction on rights conferred by this Part while martial law is in force in any area.—  
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Part, Parliament may by law  
indemnify any person in the service of the Union or of a State or any other person in respect of  
any act done by him in connection with the maintenance or restoration of order in any area  
within the territory of India where martial law was in force or validate any sentence passed,  
punishment inflicted, forfeiture ordered or other act done under martial law in such area.

#### 6.2 7 .2. Description

Article 34 pertains to the restrictions on the fundamental rights while martial law is in force in  
any area. (Martial law means law made by military authorities. Such a law is imposed by the  
President, since he is the supreme commander of armed forces). The article gives indemnity by  
law in respect to acts done during operations of martial law. Here we have to note that the  
Constitution does not have a provision of authorizing the proclamation of martial law. The  
article simply means that if there is a Government servant on duty, then he/ she is indemnified  
for the acts done by him or her in connection with maintenance of law and order in the area  
where martial law is in force. This act of indemnity cannot be challenged in any court on the  
ground of contravention with any of the fundamental rights.

Legislation to give effect to the provisions of this Part.

Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution,

a) Parliament shall have, and the Legislature of a State shall not have, power to make laws—  
i. with respect to any of the matters which under clause (3) of article 16, clause (3) of  
article 32, article 33 and article 34 may be provided for by law made by Parliament; and  
ii. for prescribing punishment for those acts which are declared to be offences under this  
Part; and Parliament shall, as soon as may be after the commencement of this  
Constitution, make laws for prescribing punishment for the acts referred to in sub-  
clause (ii);  
b) any law in force immediately before the commencement of this Constitution in the territory  
of India with respect to any of the matters referred to in sub-clause (i) of clause (a) or

Article 35 states that power to make laws to give effect to FR shall vest only in the Parliament

Fundamental Rights.

## 7\. Are Fundamental Rights Absolute Student Notes:^

Fundamental Rights don’t give absolute powers to an individual. They are restricted rights. In  
Gopalan case, 1950, SC held that there cannot be any such thing as absolute or unmonitored  
liberty, for that would lead to anarchy. On other hand, if the state has absolute powers, then  
that would lead to tyranny. The purpose of Fundamental Rights is to establish rule of law and  
hence there should be a balance between individual rights and social needs. That’s why  
constitution empowers the Parliament to provide reasonable and fair restrictions on the  
Fundamental Rights.

**Grounds of reasonable restrictions are as follows:**

-   The grounds mentioned in article 19(2).
-   Advancement of SC, ST, OBC and other weaker sections of society including women and  
    children.
-   In the interest of general public, public order, decency and morality
-   Sovereignty and integrity of India
-   Security of the state
-   Friendly relation with foreign state

## 8\. Criticism of Fundamental Rights

-   Although called fundamental rights, these are subject to lot of restrictions. Further what  
    constitutes “reasonableness” is subject to differing interpretations by courts.
-   These rights provide only political rights. However political freedom is meaningless unless  
    there is social and freedom also.
-   These rights are not sacrosanct. They can be abridged by the Parliament. Most of these get  
    suspended during the operation of national emergency.
-   The remedy in case Fundamental Rights are violated, is costly, time consuming and in  
    practice inaccessible to vast majority of the population.

**_Approach:_**

-   There should be clear understanding of the distinction between equality before the  
    law and equal protection of the laws.

-   Also a clear understanding of what kind of classification is allowed by the Student Notes:^  
    constitution while making laws. Quoting some examples will make answer more  
    relevant.
-   No general discussion on equality before the law or rule of law and its importance  
    as the question specifically asks about its application.

**_Answer:_**

-   Article 14 is a declaration of equality of all persons within the territory of India,  
    implying thereby the absence of any privilege in favor of any individual. It means  
    that no man is above the law of the land and that every person irrespective of his  
    rank or status is subject to the ordinary law.
-   But the concept of equality before law does not involve the idea of absolute  
    equality amongst all. This article includes the phrase ‘equal protection of the laws’  
    which means right to equal treatment in similar circumstances.
-   What Article 14 prohibits is ‘class legislation’ and not classification for the purpose  
    of legislation. But the classification should not be arbitrary. It should be reasonable  
    and be based on qualities and characteristics that have relation to the object of  
    legislation. So Article 14 does not mean that every person shall be taxed equally,  
    but that persons under the same character should be taxed by the same standard.
-   In order to be reasonable and not arbitrary, a classification must satisfy two  
    conditions. First the classification should be found on an intelligible difference  
    which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others. Second the  
    difference must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the  
    act.
-   Also the guarantee of equal protection is applicable not only in the making of laws  
    but also their administration and implementation. So a procedure different from  
    that laid down by the ordinary law can be prescribed for a particular class of  
    persons if the discrimination is based on a reasonable classification.  
    **_2\. The government cannot condition receipt of public benefits on waiver of fundamental  
    rights. Discuss this statement in context of the recent issues raised in the Aadhaar  
    petitions.  
    Approach_** _:_  
    This question is based on Supreme Court’s examination of Aadhaar Card  
    implementation by Government of India. So the answer should consist of these points:
-   Briefly discuss past directives of Supreme Court regarding Aadhar Card.
-   Examine the current controversy surrounding this matter.
-   Also, discuss the benefits of Aadhaar
-   In conclusion discuss the way ahead.

**_Answer:_**

```
In the context of the use of Aadhar card for welfare schemes, there is an ongoing
debate in the country between the privacy rights of citizens and their protection for rich
and poor alike.
In 2013, Supreme Court had directed that no person should suffer for not getting
Aadhaar. The present government requested the Supreme Court to revoke its order as
it intends to use Aadhaar for various services.
```

```
Supreme Court stated that Aadhaar will not be used for any other purposes except PDS,
kerosene and LPG distribution system and made it clear that even for availing these
facilities Aadhaar card will not be mandatory.

Issues with Aadhar: Student Notes:
```

-   As gleaned from various SC judgements Right to Privacy is an integral aspect of the  
    Right to Life and Liberty. In this context, the Supreme Court restrained the central  
    government and the UIDAI from sharing data with any third party without the  
    consent of the Aadhaar-holder in writing.
-   Government’s argument that poor must be prepared to surrender their right of  
    privacy to continue receiving the subsidy payments and other benefits was rejected  
    by the SC.
-   These is no comprehensive legislation on privacy issues raised by Aadhar.
-   Every government’s most basic obligation is to protect its citizens’ rights — both  
    their right to sustenance and their right to the privacy that enables freedom equally.  
    On the other hand, Aadhar has a huge potential in redrawing the public service delivery  
    mechanism. It carries with it a large group of advantages including better targeting,  
    plugging leakages etc. Aadhar is the central plank of a plethora of ambitious projects  
    mooted by government like Digi locker, e-sign etc.

```
The need of the hour is to address the privacy concerns of citizens by incorporating
adequate and necessary safeguards. Without parliamentary sanction and legislative
backing, the process is legally untenable and unacceptable.

**_3\. Reservation policy is a logical and useful strategy for ensuring justice and providing_**  
**_equal opportunity to the socially oppressed groups. Discuss._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Explain how it ensures justice and equal opportunity.
-   Flip side of current reservation policy.
-   Conclusion based on your analysis.  
    **_Answer:_**

```
The reservation policy was a corrective step towards the castes that were subjugated
and marginalized since centuries. Since, they were not in position to compete openly
for the employment and education opportunities, reservation came as a great equalizer.
```

```
It has been useful in ensuring justice and equal opportunity to the socially oppressed
groups due to following reasons:
```

-   **Increase opportunities** – It provides greater opportunities for the backward classes  
    to break the shackles of oppression in a society where still caste plays a dominant  
    role.
-   **Equitable distribution of benefits of development –** It increases the possibility of  
    distributing the benefits of development equally and reduce inequality in the  
    society.
-   **New social order –** It helps in securing a just position to the underprivileged in the  
    society and an opportunity to rise on social scale.
-   **Political and economic power-** It has led to emergence of political and economic  
    leaders among the lower castes giving them confidence that had been missing for  
    centuries.  
    However, reservation has been a matter of continuous debate in Indian polity. It is  
    opposed due to following reasons:
-   Hardening caste identities and promoting caste based politics.
-   Replacing of merit by mediocrity especially in cases of promotion.
-   Political attempts to include more and more castes in the reserved list for votes

```

-   Reservation and anti-reservation agitations triggering violence like that in Haryana Student Notes:^  
    and Gujarat.
-   Increasing discontent among advanced castes due to misuse of this policy.
-   Concentration of reservation of benefits by the well to do segments of the lower  
    castes rather than benefitting the needy amongst them.

```
Thus, without doubt the policy has been proved to be a great equalizer, but it is also
true that it has been misused. Moreover, it leaves out the poor and marginalized of
other sections that need a push. Hence, it would be judicious to review the policy by
improving its accessibility to every stratum of the lower castes. A gradual movement
towards reservation based on economic criteria is now a feasible idea with the advent
of ICT tools like ADHAAR.
```

**_4\. Discuss the issue of reservation in promotions for SCs and STs in public employment in_**  
**_the light of various judicial pronouncements and constitutional amendments._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Introduce by briefly touching upon reservation as a policy for upgrading the  
    depressed classes in India.
-   Highlight the introduction of reservation in promotions in India in the aftermath of  
    the Indira Sawhney judgement.
-   Discuss the progress on the matter of promotions in public employment by  
    highlighting the subsequent legislations and judicial interventions around the same.
-   Conclude with a brief remark on the latest judicial explanation on the matter.  
    **_Answer:_**

```
Reservation in India is part of the world’s largest affirmative action programme for the
depressed classes. However, it has always remained a contentious issue especially in
the matter of promotions in public employment.
In the Indira Sawhney & Others vs Union of India, 1992 case, the Supreme Court held
that the reservation in appointments, under Article 16(4) of the Constitution, do not
apply to promotions. However, subsequent to this judgement, a series of constitutional
amendments and judicial pronouncements were made, which negated this judgement:
```

-   **The 77th Constitution Amendment Act, 1995** inserted Article **16(4A)** , which  
    enabled the state to make any law regarding reservation in promotions for the SCs  
    and STs. Also, **Article 16(4B)** provided that reserved promotion posts for SCs and  
    STs that remain unfilled can be carried forward to the subsequent year.
-   In the **M Nagaraj case** , the Supreme Court also upheld the validity of the  
    Parliament’s decision to extend reservations in promotions. However, it introduced  
    three conditions, essentially necessitating the state to:  
    o Provide **proof for the backwardness** of the class benefitting from the  
    reservation,  
    o Provide **proof for its inadequate representation** in the position/service; and  
    o Show how reservations in promotions would further the **administrative**  
    **efficiency** as mandated by Article 335.  
    However, the first condition was rejected in Jarnail Singh vs Lachhmi Narain Gupta  
    case.
-   The Nagaraj judgement was further used in **BK Pavitra vs Union of India-I** case to  
    strike down the legislation passed subsequent to the 85th Constitution Amendment  
    Act, 2001 by the Karnataka assembly in 2002 that provided for **consequential**  
    **seniority**.

```

```
o The court held that the government had not collected quantifiable data on the Student Notes:
three parameters – inadequacy of representation, backwardness and the
impact on overall administrative efficiency – before extending reservations in
promotions.
```

-   However, in the recent Supreme Court judgement in **BK Pavitra vs Union of India-II,**  
    it upheld the validity of the Karnataka Extension of Consequential Seniority to  
    Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of Reservation Act, 2018. The Act  
    gives a one-time promotion to SC/ST employees, and is referred to as a “catch-up”  
    clause.  
    o The court held that Article 16 (4A) enables the state to provide for reservation  
    in matters of promotion to SC/ST. Further, the opinion regarding the adequacy  
    of representation of the SCs and STs in the state public services is a matter  
    which forms a part of the subjective satisfaction of the state.  
    The latest 2018 judgement has also examined various associated issues related to  
    reservation in promotion debate such as -
-   **Issue of merit and efficiency:** The court held that the efficiency of administration  
    must be defined in an inclusive sense, where a **‘meritorious’ candidate** is not  
    merely one who is ‘talented’ or ‘successful’ but also one whose appointment fulfills  
    the constitutional goals of uplifting members of the SCs and STs and ensuring a  
    diverse and representative administration.
-   **Notion of substantive equality** : It also held that Indian Constitution envisages not  
    just a formal equality of opportunity but the achievement of substantive equality.
-   **Issue of creamy layer:** It held that progression in a cadre based on promotion  
    cannot be treated as the acquisition of creamy layer status.

```
Overall, the judgment asserts that the policy of reservations is a tool to achieve
substantive equality and due representation in public services.

**_5\. Freedom of expression is a right, however, it does not grant the right to defame any_**  
**_person. Discuss the statement in the light of various Supreme Court judgments._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Discuss freedom of expression as right and the reasonable restriction on it.
-   Justify right to defame is not included in freedom of expression with the help of  
    various Supreme Court’s judgements.

**_Answer:_**

```
The freedom of expression is guaranteed as fundamental right by the Indian
Constitution under Article 19(1) (a). It implies that every citizen has right to express his
views, opinions, belief and convictions freely.
However, this right is not absolute. The Constitution (Article 19(2)) has imposed certain
reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the freedom of expression including
defamation.
```

```
Defamation refers to the act of publication of defamatory content that lowers the
reputation of an individual or an entity when observed through the perspective of an
ordinary man. It can be done by words, spoken or written or visual representation.
Defamation in India is both a civil and a criminal offence. Defamation as a criminal
offence is listed under section 499 of the Indian Penal Code.
```

```
Recently, the Supreme Court, in Subramanian Swamy vs Union of India case upheld the
constitutionality of criminal defamation. As per SC, the right to free speech does not

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
mean that a citizen can defame the other. The judgement has underlined individual’s Student Notes:
fundamental right to live with dignity and reputation.
```

-   Protection of reputation is a fundamental right under Art-21, right to life with  
    dignity and also a human right.
-   Criminalization of defamation to protect individual dignity and reputation is a  
    “reasonable restriction”

```
In another case, R. Rajagopal versus State of Tamil Nadu, famously known as the Auto
Shankar Case, Supreme Court said that the newspaper could publish the life story or
autobiographies of people so far as it appears from the public records even without the
consent or authority. But if they go beyond the public record and publish, they may be
invading the privacy and causing defamation of the officials named in the publication
which is unacceptable.
```

```
According to these judgments, the theory of balancing of rights dictates that along with
the right to freedom of speech and expression, there is a correlative duty on citizens
not to interfere with the liberty of others, as everyone is entitled to the dignity of
person and of reputation.

**_6\. Criticism about the judiciary should be welcomed, so long as criticisms do not hamper_**  
**_the “administration of justice”. In this context discuss whether the power of contempt_**  
**_of court given to the higher judiciary limits the freedom granted by Article 19(1)(a)_**  
**_and whether these two can be reconciled._**

**_Approach:_**

-   In the introduction briefly address the key concern of the statement and link it to  
    the argument on power of contempt and freedom of speech and expression.
-   Discuss the need of contempt powers with judiciary.
-   Discuss the implications of contempt powers on freedom of speech.
-   Discuss how these two can be reconciled.

**_Answer:_**

```
Administration of justice requires strong safeguards for the judiciary. Thus:
```

-   Article 129 and 215 of the Constitution of India empower the Supreme Court and  
    High Court respectively to punish people for their contempt.  
    The Contempt of Court Act, 1971 delineate contempt powers of judiciary to:
-   Prevent scandalisation or lowering the authority of any court.
-   Prevent interference with the due course of any judicial proceedings.
-   Strengthen court’s image as legal authority and that no one is above the law.
-   Ensure one could not defy court orders according to one’s own free will.  
    In the context freedom of speech and expression, a right underpinned by article 19 1(a),  
    contempt of court is considered a reasonable restriction under Article 19 (2), which  
    empowers contempt laws.  
    Critics observe that:
-   Judiciary has routinely invoked its contempt powers to punish expressions of  
    dissent on grounds of such speech undermining or scandalising the judiciary’s  
    authority.
-   Acts of speech and expression that do not necessarily impede with the actual  
    administration of justice have been punished invoking the idea of reputation of  
    judiciary in the eyes of the public.

Rights under article 19 (1) (a) are important as they: Student Notes:
```

-   Empower citizens to express their opinion which is necessary for good public  
    policies.
-   Are important in themselves for ensuring a good life, also enshrined under Article  
    21 of the constitution.  
    Thus, it becomes imperative to reconcile the freedom of speech and the contempt  
    power of the courts. It can be ensured by taking the following into consideration:
-   Judiciary itself underlined guidelines that envisage economic use of the jurisdiction  
    on the one hand and harmonization between free criticism and the judiciary, e.g.  
    Mulgaonkar case 1978. Also, of note are observations in cases such as Ram Dayal  
    Markarha v. state of Madhya Pradesh 1978; Conscientious Group v. Mohammed  
    Yunus 1987; P.N. Duda b. P. Shiv Shankar 1988; Sanjay Narayan, Hindustan Times v.  
    High Court of Allahabad 2011.
-   The 2006 amendment in the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 states that “court may  
    permit, in any proceedings for contempt of court, justification by truth as a valid  
    defence if it is satisfied that it is in public interest and the request for invoking the  
    said defence is bonafide”.  
    International standards and laws of other democracies would be informative and  
    enable us to arrive at the right standards. e.g. in European democracies such as  
    Germany, France, Belgium, Austria, Italy, there is no power to commit for contempt for  
    scandalising the court. In the U.K., the offence of scandalising the court has become  
    obsolete. In the United States, contempt power is used against the press and  
    publication only if there is a clear imminent and present danger to the disposal of a  
    pending case.

    which jeopardized the security of the nation. Can the actions of media be justified in  
    the context of right to freedom and speech? Discuss the principles and concerns that  
    the media should keep in mind while covering such incidents._**

**_Approach:_**

```
In introduction some background about the role of electronic media during 26/11
attack and Supreme Court’s observation should be provided. Then discuss the rightness
or wrongness of media actions in context balancing freedom of speech with national
security and right to life. Then outline few principles, which should be adhered to by
media while covering such sensitive incidents.
```

**_Answer:_**

```
In hunger of TRP and in a blind rush to present the news before any other news channel
the media during the 26/11 attack on Mumbai worked utterly irresponsibly. They kept
providing instant news update which kept the terrorist and their cross border handlers
informed and updated about the security operation and put many lives at risk.
```

```
About the role of media Supreme Court observed that it is not possible to find out
whether the security forces actually suffered any casualty or injuries on account of the
way their operations were being displayed on the TV screen. But it is beyond doubt that
the way their operations were freely shown made the task of the security forces not
only exceedingly difficult but also dangerous and risky.
```

```
Any attempt to justify the conduct of the TV channels by citing the right to freedom of
speech and expression would be totally wrong and unacceptable in such a situation as
national security when many lives are at risk cannot be hold hostage to the claim of a

```
right which is being misused. The visuals that were shown live by the TV channels could Student Notes:
have also been shown after all the terrorists were neutralized. But, in that case the TV
programmes would not have had the same shrill, scintillating and chilling effect and
would not have shot up the TRP ratings of the channels. It must, therefore, be held that
by covering live the terrorists attack on Mumbai in the way it was done, the Indian TV
channels were not serving any national interest or social cause. On the contrary they
were acting in their own commercial interests putting the national security in jeopardy.
```

```
There are still no regulations in place by the government regarding coverage of news
live which could compromise national interest. But then, do we need to wait for a
regulation? When it comes to national interest, you don't wait for a regulation, you just
act responsibly.
```

```
Principles: There can be some principles which media should keep in mind while
covering an incident which affects national security or can result in loss of life; such as:
```

-   Human life must be given utmost importance, media should over look TRP and  
    commercial interest when human life is at stake.
-   National security must never be compromised in name of freedom of speech and  
    expression. Media must act sensibly and responsibly.
-   Live telecast of such incident can wait for some time, if it can help in saving life or  
    serving justice.
-   Sensationalisation of security issue should never be done.

```
Concerns:
This irresponsible behaviour can do much harm to the argument that any regulatory
mechanism for the media must only come from within. And it can hamper freedom of
speech and expression. This kind of behaviour may also dilute the role of media as
fourth pillar of democracy. Therefore, media must keep the safety of security agency as
well as secrecy of intelligence agencies at work while reporting such incidences.

Extra judicial killings
An extrajudicial killing is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the
sanction of law. There have been allegations and instances of judicial killings by the
police and the armed forces in India.
This has raised serious concerns in handling extrajudicial killings in India, which include
lacunae in government’s approach:
```

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   Inadequate investigation of extrajudicial killing due to absence of an independent Student Notes:  
    body to investigate such complaints.
-   Limited success of NHRC as guidelines outlined by NHRC are often not implemented  
    by the government.
-   Doctrines of sovereign and official immunity which protect officials: Legal barriers  
    for the prosecution of public servants, including the requirement for ‘prior  
    sanction’ from the government.
-   Failure of government to ratify UN Convention against Torture and the International  
    Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances.
-   Lack of adequate compensation system for the families of victims of extrajudicial  
    killings.
-   Low conviction rates and lack of transparency regarding internal disciplinary  
    hearings in armed forces. Judicial delays also make conviction difficult at times.
-   AFSPA takes away some accountability on part of public officials in the national  
    interest.  
    **Judiciary’s response:**
-   R.S. Sodhi vs State of U.P. 1992: In this judgement, the Supreme Court held that  
    every police encounter must be investigated.
-   In 2014, the SC provided detailed guidelines to check extra judicial killings.  
    o Independent investigation into encounters, by the CID or police team of  
    another police station under the supervision of a senior officer.  
    o Probe report shall be forwarded to the court concerned so that a magisterial  
    inquiry is carried out and a final report submitted.  
    o No out-of-turn promotion or instant gallantry rewards shall be bestowed on the  
    concerned officers soon after the occurrence.  
    o If an incriminating chargesheet is filed against the police officers, the trial must  
    be concluded expeditiously, apart from initiating disciplinary action against  
    such officers and placing them under suspension.  
    o The relatives of a victim can also approach a Sessions Court if the authorities  
    fail to comply with the Supreme Court directives  
    Recently, the Supreme Court ordered a CBI investigation into cases of suspected extra-  
    judicial killings in Manipur based on a PIL. Similarly, the court had last year ruled that  
    the armed forces cannot escape investigation for excesses even in places where they  
    enjoy special powers under AFSPA. The court also addressed the Centre to take note of  
    the NHRC’s concerns and remedy the situation. By doing so, the court has reiterated

```
The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 is a Central
legislation that details the aspects of the right of children within the age group of six to
fourteen years i.e. to free and compulsory elementary education, under Article 21-A
inserted by the 86th Amendment Act, 2002.
```

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
This Act serves as a building block to ensure that every child has his or her right (as an Student Notes:
entitlement) to get a quality elementary education. In fact, it also mandates private
schools to admit at least 25% of the children without any fee. The Act seeks to promote
child-friendly school through measures such as compliance with infrastructure and
teacher norms for an effective learning environment.
Section 30(1) of the Act introduced that a child cannot be detained in any class till the
completion of elementary education to prevent damage to their self-esteem, increased
dropouts and increased social problems like begging and petty crimes. It was aimed at
increasing Gross Enrolment Ratio.
```

```
However, recently, the Lok Sabha has passed an amendment bill to abolish the No-
Detention policy. Two committees of Geeta Bhukkal and TSR Subramaniam also
recommended it to be removed in a phased manner. Issues with this policy are:
```

-   It leads to a situation where there remain **no incentives for children to learn and**  
    **for teachers to teach**. This leads to students lacking required educational  
    competence, knowledge and skills relevant to higher classes. For e.g. the number of  
    students failing in class 9 examination has been on an increase in many States.
-   It **affects the quality of classroom teaching** as well because at higher levels,  
    teacher is unable to teach the curriculum at an expected pace due to promotion of  
    all students with difference in capabilities and understanding.
-   It also affects teachers’ ability to control students as teacher loses leverage over  
    students and many government schools turn into mere "mid-day meal" providers.
-   Fall in learning outcomes and automatic promotion of children **only rolls over and**  
    **postpones the problem of dropouts** as seen from shoot up of dropouts in class 8 at  
    the end of elementary stage.

```
In this context, the no-detention policy is being scrapped. At the same time, there are
equally strong arguments against the scrapping of the no-detention policy:
```

-   This will mean that the State is blaming students (many of whom are first-  
    generation learners) for their failure to learn in class.
-   The RTE Act made a range of other promises such as upgrading quality of teaching,  
    regular assessment through Continous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE). All  
    these along with no-detention policy had to go hand in hand. No-detention policy  
    does not mean no evaluation.
-   Further, bringing back the old pass-fail system without making proper course  
    correction in other areas may undermine the egalitarian promise of the RTE.

```
To conclude, detention should be resorted to only after giving the child remedial
coaching and extra chances to prove his capability. Education should be inclusive and
should have a common curriculum, so that all children become familiar with the basic
concepts, tenets, principles and ethos of the Indian education.

-   Give the arguments for or against along with some contemporary examples. Student Notes:^

**_Answer:_**

```
Article 21 gives people the right to lead a meaningful, complete and dignified life. In
case of terminally ill patients though, this right cannot be justly exercised. Thus, it has
been argued that in consonance with right to live with dignity, a person who cannot do
so, must have a right to die with dignity at least. Euthanasia or assisted suicide has
been argued as a means to put the ‘patients out of their misery’. In the 2011 Aruna
Shaunbaug judgement, the Supreme Court allowed passive euthanasia, subject to
safeguards and fair procedure requiring mandatory approval of a High Court bench in
every case based on consultation with a panel of experts. Passive euthanasia refers to
withholding or withdrawing treatment necessary to maintain life.
As per the ruling in Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab, 1996 , true meaning of the word ‘life’
in Article 21 means life with human dignity. The ‘Right to Die’ if any, is inherently
inconsistent with the “Right to Life” as is “death” with “Life”.
The 196th report of the Law Commission of India spoke in favour of passive euthanasia.
```

-   Arguments for euthanasia:  
    o it is a civil right  
    o it is a question of personal autonomy  
    o it is necessary to ensure that no one dies in painful agony  
    o Protective guidelines can be made to prevent misuse of such a law
-   Arguments against:  
    o Assisted dying nay be used illegally for personal gains  
    o It may be promoted as a cheaper alternative to medicinal care  
    o Hospital care and proper treatment provide morally acceptable answers
-   Both euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in Netherlands, Belgium and  
    Luxembourg, while euthanasia is legalised in Columbia.  
    The **Medical Treatment of Terminally Ill Patients Bill 2016** seeks to codify the  
    framework decided in the Aruna Shaunbaug judgement. Some concerns are:
-   It does not employ enough safeguards for proper execution of advance directives

    **_11\. Despite the phrase 'due process of law' not being included in Article 21, the Supreme  
    Court, over the years, has adopted the doctrines of 'procedural due process' and  
    'substantive due process' into Indian constitutional law. Comment.  
    Approach:_**
-   Giving a brief account of Article 21, bring out the difference between the procedure  
    established by law and due process of law.
-   Then give reasons due to which due process was not incorporated into the Indian  
    Constitution.
-   Bring out various judgements to establish the facts that India judiciary over the  
    time has established its conformity towards the principle of due process over  
    procedure established by law.  
    **_Answer:_**

```
Article 21, of Indian Constitution provides that “No person shall be deprived of his life
or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law”. Procedure
established by law, a positive law concept means that a law that is duly enacted by the
legislature is valid if correct procedure has been followed.

```
As incorporated in the US Constitution, due process checks if a law is fair, just and not Student Notes:
arbitrary, thus ensuring a fair treatment.
```

```
Substantive due process prohibits the government from infringing on fundamental
constitutional liberties. By contrast, procedural due process refers to the procedural
limitations placed on the manner in which a law is administered, applied, or enforced.
Thus, procedural due process prohibits the government from arbitrarily depriving
individuals of legally protected interests without first giving them notice and the
opportunity to be heard.
The Indian Constitution by incorporating ‘procedure established by law’ adopts a
healthy synthesis of Parliamentary Sovereignty and Judicial Supremacy. However
despite the textual choices of the framers of Indian Constitution, t “due process” found
a back door entry into Indian Constitutional interpretation in late 1970s through the
right to equality.
Until the decision in Maneka Gandhi case, the view which prevailed in the Supreme
Court was that there was no guarantee in the Constitution against arbitrary legislation
encroaching upon personal liberty. This case overturned the majority in A.K. Gopalan
vs State of Madras where the majority decision adopted a narrow interpretation of
‘procedure established by law.’.
```

```
Contrastingly the Maneka Gandhi Case took the view that:
```

-   A law coming under Art. 21 must also satisfy the requirements of Art 19.
-   Once the test of reasonableness is imported to determine the validity of law  
    depriving a person of his liberty, it follows that such laws shall be invalid if it  
    violates the principles of natural justice.  
    Over a course of judgments, the Courts indicated that “due process” has firmly become  
    a part of the Indian Constitutional law recently reflected in Judgements such as Selvi  
    vs State of Karnataka, where constitutionality of investigative narco-analysis was  
    challenged , held it to be permissible only with the consent of the ‘subject’..

```
Under a wide construction of Article 21, Judiciary’s view on issues such as Khap
Panchayat, Custodial death, Right to die, Right to education etc. gave supremacy to ‘due
process’ over ‘procedure established by law.
```

**_12\. Article 22 of the Indian Constitution is a necessary evil. Discuss._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Briefly state the provision of Article 22 in the Indian Constitution.
-   Give arguments related to contentious provisions in the Article 22.
-   Explain why these provisions are necessary
-   Conclude based on the aforesaid points.

**_Answer:_**

```
Article 22 of the Indian Constitution provides that no person who is arrested shall be
detained in custody without being informed about the grounds of the same. It further
contains :
```

-   **Article 22 (1)** which says that the person detained has the right to be informed  
    about the grounds of his/her arrest, along with the right to consult/defended by a  
    legal practitioner.
-   **Article 22 (2)** which provides other safeguards such as the detained person should  
    be produced before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest.

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
However, there are contentious provisions in the Article, which include: Student Notes:
```

-   The Article 22 (3) denies the rights provided in Article 22 (1) and Article 22 (2) to  
    the person who is an ‘enemy alien’ or if a person is arrested or detained under a  
    law providing for preventive detention.
-   It bases the formulation of preventive detention laws in the name of **‘national**  
    **security’ and ‘maintenance of public order’,** which are **not clearly defined** in the  
    Constitution.
-   It **undermines the principle of ‘innocent until proven guilty’** by sanctioning the use  
    of past criminality as a basis for imposing coercive force on citizens (by externing  
    them) without them actually being adjudged guilty of committing a criminal act.  
    However, under certain circumstances the freedom of the individual needs to be  
    superseded in the interests of the state. Its necessity can be understood from the  
    following:
-   In the Constituent Assembly debates, Dr B.R. Ambedkar argued that the  
    government shall have to detain a person **endangering the security of the nation**  
    **and public services.**
-   **Secessionist movements,** which threaten national security and integrity require a  
    strict law to enable the state to counter them.
-   The Supreme Court has held that in the matter of preventive detention, once the  
    **detaining authority is subjectively satisfied** about the various offences labelled  
    against the detenu, habituality in continuing the same, difficulty in controlling him  
    under normal circumstances, **he/she is free to pass appropriate order to detain**  
    **him/her.**  
    Further, safeguards have been provided in the Article 22 itself in case of preventive  
    detention such as limit on the duration of detention, communication of grounds of  
    detention, affording him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against  
    the order etc.  
    In a diverse country like India where a lot of subversive activities are carried out within  
    the country and there is a threat from other non-state actors, the idealism needs to be  
    balanced by the adoption of realism. Also, timely judicial intervention and further  
    strengthening of procedural safeguards would prevent the space for misuse.  
    **_13\. Is the freedom to profess, practice and propagate religion, provided under article 25  
    of the Indian constitution a historical mistake committed by constituent assembly,  
    discuss in view of the recent controversy on religious conversions?_**

**_Approach:_**

```
Discuss briefly the socio-political context of constituent assembly debates. Discuss
Article 25 in context of spate of recent religious conversions and debates it ignited.
```

**_Answer:_**

```
Historically, the defining characteristic of Indian society has been that it remained
accommodative of variety of religious views and practice. Unfortunately it created the
condition during freedom struggle of religion being used as potent political tool leading
to communalization of politics and partition of nation. However, makers of constitution
took the liberal view of religion considering it as the matter of individual conscience in
which state has no role to play. This secular stand is reflected in article 25 of the
constitution.

```
The Article 25 of the constitution guarantees the freedom of religion as fundamental Student Notes:
right. It consists of two parts, freedom of conscience with respect to religion and free
profession, practice and propagation of religion. However, enjoyment of these rights is
subjected to public order, morality and health. The recent debates on religious
conversions have brought the two provisions of the article into conflict. The right to
freely profess, practice and propagate their religion has been used as by some religious
organizations belonging to majoritarian religion to manufacture conversions by using
external means of force or allurement. It impinges on freedom of conscience with
respect to religious beliefs and practice. Further right to freely profess, practice and
propagate their religion was conceived to give space to minority religions to exist in
hindu majoritarian society. The constitutional makers were apprehensive of minority
religions might lose its identity under influence of majority religion which goes against
spirit of unity and diversity. Supreme Court also dismissed many anti-conversion laws in
MP and Odisha as unconstitutional. Hence our constitutional makers have very broad
vision and subtle understanding of how power operates in the deeply religious society
like India.
```

**_14\. Right to freedom of religion cannot be allowed to deny right to equality and_**  
**_individual dignity. Discuss in the light of constitutional provisions and recent judicial_**  
**_pronouncements._**

**_Approach:_**

-   In introduction, mention the provisions of the Constitution that deal with religious  
    freedoms.
-   Mention the recent judgments that deal with balancing religious rights with other  
    fundamental rights of the Constitution.
-   Analyze their impact.

**_Answer:_**

```
The Constitution of India under Article 25 read with the preamble gives equal
entitlement to all persons regarding freedom of conscience and freely professing,
practicing and propagating religion. However, the Article itself subjects this freedom to
other provisions of fundamental right.
Similarly, Articles 26-28 deal with the matters of religion. Article 26 allows religious
denominations to determine for itself the manner in which it manages its religious
affairs provided that it follows three criterion – system of belief conducive to their
spiritual well-being, common organization and distinctive name. Article 15 also bars
discrimination on the grounds of religion.
Thus, right to freedom of religion has to be balanced with other rights such as equality
and non-discrimination prescribed under Articles 14, 15 read with Article 21 of the
Constitution.
In this light, various judicial pronouncements in recent times have provided further
impetus to the argument:
```

-   Mumbai HC judgment removed the ban on the entry of women in **Shani**  
    **Shingnapur temple and Haji Ali Darga**.
-   Supreme Court 4:1 verdict, in _Indian Young Lawyers Association_ v. State _of Kerala_ ,  
    opened the doors of the Sabarimala temple to women of all ages who were  
    hitherto banned from entering the temple.
-   The Supreme Court struck down Triple Talaq on the grounds of violating right to  
    equality and discrimination between women belonging to different communities.

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   The Supreme Court has further ruled that the Muslim women have a right to legally Student Notes:^  
    adopt children, even though their personal law do not give them that right.  
    In these verdicts Supreme Court have stood by the women and enabled gender justice.  
    Also, in the context of mob lynching and cow vigilantism, the apex Court observed that  
    the State has a positive obligation to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all  
    individuals irrespective of race, caste, class or religion.  
    **_15\. Special rights are not privileges but they are granted to make it possible for minorities  
    to preserve their identity, culture and traditions. Elaborate in the context of India with  
    examples._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Bring out the need for extending special rights to minorities.
-   Discuss these special rights in the context of India (viz. constitutional protection to  
    minorities).
-   Give examples of government policies/institutions contributing to preservation of  
    minorities in India.

**_Answer:_**

```
In a democratic setup, there is always a tendency of majoritarian domination. In a polity
based on rule of law, this means that every group of citizens must be given sufficient
protections, especially with regard to preserving their identity and culture. Special
rights granted to minorities ensure these. Also, idea of rights of minorities does not
include any special political privileges. The idea is not to treat minorities as privileged
section of the population but to give them a sense of security. These rights are
universally accepted and are laid down in United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities.
```

#### In India, the safeguards for minorities under the constitution of India are in the

#### form of fundamental rights:

-   Article 14 provides for equality before the law and equal protection of law. Thus  
    minorities cannot be put to any legal disability vis- a-vis the majority.
-   Articles 15 and 16 prohibit discrimination ONLY on certain grounds (religion, race,  
    caste, sex or place of birth).
-   Article 29 explicitly provides the right to every section of citizens having distinct  
    language, script or culture to conserve the same.
-   Article 30 accords the rights to religious/linguistic minorities to establish and  
    administer educational institutions.  
    Further, following articles deal exclusively with linguistic minorities:
-   Art. 347- Power of President to direct a language to be included as an official  
    language of a state if a substantial proportion of the state population desires
-   Art. 350- Representation of a grievance to a Union/State authority in any of the  
    languages used in the Union/State as the case may be.
-   Art. 350A- Facilities for instruction in mother-tongue at primary stage
-   Art. 350 B- Provision of special Officer for Linguistic Minorities  
    Examples of protection of minority rights:
-   Provision of National Commission for Minorities, National Commission for Minority  
    Educational Institutions and National Minorities Development Finance Corporation  
    (NMDFC)
-   Instruction through mother tongues at the Primary stage of education

-   Implementation of Three-language Formula. Student Notes:^

-   Developmental schemes like Nai Manzil, USTAAD, Humari Darohar,Jiyo Parsi ,  
    Maulana Azad National Fellowship For Minority Students , Nalanda Project etc.
-   Dissemination of information in vernacular languages.  
    These provisions do not give any privilege to minorities. They ensure that their progress  
    is not stalled because of ideology of the government in power. These rights recognize  
    their special conditions as well as possible challenges of a democracy. Their  
    implementation is the constitutional/statutory responsibility of the State to ensure  
    inclusive growth and development.  
    **_16\. Where there is a right, there is a remedy. In this context, discuss the nature and  
    significance of writs in India with adequate examples._**

**_Approach:_**

-   In introduction briefly highlight the significance of the above statement in the  
    context of various kinds of writs in Indian Constitution.
-   Mention the various kinds of writs and their usage.
-   Cite relevant case laws.

**_Answer:_**

```
Article 32 and 226 of the Indian Constitution provide for Right to Constitutional
Remedies, for the enforcement of fundamental rights, which has been regarded as
“Heart and Soul” of Indian Constitution by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. It is done by the higher
judiciary through five kinds of writs.
The nature of these writs:
```

-   **Habeas Corpus:** Literally meaning to have the body, this writ is considered to be the  
    ‘bulwark of individual liberty’ against illegal and unjustifiable detention. It can be  
    filed by any person on behalf of the other person and can be issued against both  
    public authorities and private individuals..
-   **Certiorari:** It means to ‘to certify or to inform’ and is enforced against the decision  
    of a sub-ordinate authority exercising judicial or quasi judicial powers, improperly.  
    For example, the Supreme Court exercised Certiorari in _A.K Kraipak v. U.O.I_ , in  
    which selection process was quashed on the ground of bias.
-   **Prohibition:** It is issued by the court prohibiting the authority from continuing the  
    proceedings if such authority has no power or jurisdiction to decide the case. It is  
    an extraordinary prerogative writ of a preventive nature.
-   **Mandamus:** it is a judicial remedy which is in the form of an order from a superior  
    court to any governmental agency, court or public authority to do or forbear from  
    doing any specific act which that body is obliged to do under the law.
-   **Quo Warranto:** It literally means ‘by what authority’ and is issued against the  
    person who occupies a public seat without any qualification for appointment.  
    **Significance of these writs**
-   Writs are crucial in the defence of fundamental rights; without them, Part III would  
    be meaningless, because they give teeth to the rights.
-   They are powerful checks against the excesses committed by the state as under  
    article 12.
-   Using them, judiciary has interpreted many other rights as inseparable adjuncts to  
    other fundamental rights. For example, right to dignified life in Maneka Gandhi  
    Case 1978.

-   Powers of the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the constitution are limited only Student Notes:^  
    to the enforcement of fundamental rights, whereas under article 226 High Court  
    can exercise such powers for any other purpose also apart from the enforcement of  
    fundamental rights  
    The importance of writs lies in creating permissible areas of exercise of power,  
    authority and jurisdiction over administrative actions enforced by any State. Thus writs  
    as constitutional remedies operate as a check and keeps the administration of  
    government within the bounds of law.

## 1\. Genesis of Fundamental Duties in India

For any polity, its people are the ultimate  
custodians of its Constitution. It is in these  
citizens that sovereignty vests and specifically for  
India, it is in their name that the Constitution was  
adopted. Therefore, the Constitution seeks to  
empower the citizen. However, it is a reciprocal  
relationship, in the sense, that the citizen also  
empowers the Constitution. They do it by  
following it in letter and spirit, by adhering to it,  
by protecting it, and by persevering to make it  
more meaningful with words and deeds.

The Constitution of India envisaged a holistic  
approach towards civic life in a democratic polity.  
It guaranteed certain rights to the citizen as  
Fundamental Rights. Since human conduct cannot  
be confined to the realm of Fundamental Rights,  
the Constitution also envisaged certain duties,  
which are correlated to the rights, and those duties have been described as Fundamental  
Duties.

It is to be borne in mind that the framers of the Constitution did not deem it appropriate to  
incorporate those duties in the text of the Constitution when it was originally promulgated.  
There may be myriad reasons for such omission:

-   Firstly, the concept of _Dharma_ is deeply rooted in the Indian society. Citizens practice  
    certain duties as basic values irrespective of a threat of penalty.
-   Secondly, the preamble to the Constitution itself encapsulates the duties of citizensby  
    including not only the aspirations of the people i.e. the goals of the nation, but also the  
    assurances of the Constitution. Hence, it is implied that whatever is required for the  
    fulfillment of these goals be undertaken by every citizen as his duty.
-   Additionally, the Fundamental Rights enlisted in the Constitution logically bring in an  
    inference of a set of duties which are essential for their realization. If these rights are to be  
    available to people, they are obligated to perform their corresponding duties.

However, after around a quarter century in the history of independent India, it was thought fit  
to have a framework of duties in the Constitution itself. **Sardar Swaran Singh committee** was  
constituted by Indira Gandhi soon after emergency was imposed in the country. The objective  
of this committee was to study the question of amending the constitution in the light of past  
experiences and recommend amendments.

Consequently, the 42nd Amendment Act, also called the "Mini Constitution", added added a  
new part in the Constitution, Part IVA. It incorporated ten (now eleven) Fundamental Duties by  
inserting a new article 51A below article 51. The objective of incorporating the fundamental  
duties is to place before the country a code of conduct, which the citizens are expected to  
follow.

## 2\. List of Fundamental Duties

The eleven Fundamental Duties incorporated in Article 51A, by the 42nd and 86th Amendment of  
the Indian Constitution are as under:

**a)** to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and  
the National Anthem;  
**b)** to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom;

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

**c)** to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India; Student Notes:  
**d)** to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so;  
**e)** to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India  
transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices  
derogatory to the dignity of women;  
**f)** to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;  
**g)** to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life,  
and to have compassion for living creatures;  
**h)** to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform;  
**i)** to safeguard public property and to abjure violence;  
**j)** to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the  
nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement;  
**k)** who is a parent or guardian, to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the  
case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years.  
_The NCRWC recommended that following new fundamental duties should be included in Article 51-A:_

-   _Duty to vote at elections, actively participate in the democratic process of governance and to pay_  
    _taxes;_
-   _To foster a spirit of family values and responsible parenthood in the matter of education, physical and_  
    _moral well-being of children;_
-   _Duty of industrial organizations to provide education to children of their employees._

## 3\. Nature of Fundamental Duties

A. As the Directive Principles are addressed to the state, the fundamental duties are addressed  
to the citizens. The citizens enjoying the fundamental rights must respect the ideals of the  
constitution, to promote harmony and spirit of the brotherhood.  
B. Fundamental Duties are non-justiciable. It means the citizens cannot be forced to observe  
them. Some of them, are however part of the enforceable law. For example, Prevention of  
Insults to National Honor Act, 1971, and so on. However, if a citizen violates Fundamental  
Duties, his Fundamental Rights may not be restored when he approaches courts.  
C. While some of the fundamental duties are moral duties e.g. to promote a spirit of patriotism  
and to uphold the unity of India; cherishing the noble ideals of freedom struggle etc, there  
are others that are civic duties, for instance, respecting the National Flag and National  
Anthem.  
D. Fundamental Duties consist of tasks essential to the Indian way of life by incorporating  
precepts reflecting the values of the Indian tradition.  
E. Fundamental duties are extended only to Indian citizens and not foreigners, in a stark  
contrast with certain Fundamental Rights.

## 4\. Enforcement of Fundamental Duties

There is no provision in the Indian Constitution for the direct enforcement of Fundamental  
Duties and also, no sanction to prevent their violation. However, for the purpose of ascertaining  
the constitutionality of any law, if a Court finds that the law seeks to give effect to any of these  
Fundamental Duties, it may consider the law ‘reasonable’ in relation to Article 14 or 19.  
Fundamental Duties also serve as a warning to erring citizens as a guard against preventing anti-  
social activities like burning of the Constitution, destroying public property etc.

The Supreme Court of India may issue suitable guidelines along these matters in appropriate  
cases. For instance, the Supreme Court adopted the principle of “sustainable development” to  
give effect to fundamental duties enshrined under Article 51-A(g) read with Article 21, 47 and  
48 A. It also held that “precautionary principle” and “polluter pays principle” are acceptable as  
part of the law of the country.

In effect, one must understand that Parts III, IV and IV-A have a common thread flowing through  
them. While one enumerates the Fundamental Rights and another declares principles

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

fundamental to governance, the part IV-A lays down Fundamental Duties of the citizen. Hence, Student Notes:  
while interpreting any of these provisions; it is advisable to examine the scope and impact of  
such interpretation on all the three Constitutional aspects emerging from these parts.

Hence, even as Fundamental duties have not been made enforceable by a writ issued by the  
Court, one must not lose sight of the fact that the duty of every citizen is the collective duty of  
the State.

### 4.1. Available Legal Provisions for Enforcement of Fundamental

### Duties

Any non-operationalization of Fundamental Duties is not necessarily because of the lack of  
concern or non-availability of legal and other enforceable provisions; but it is more a case of  
lacuna in the strategy of implementation. Some of the legal provisions available in regard to  
enforcement of Fundamental Duties are as under:

-   In order to ensure that no disrespect is shown to the National Flag, Constitution of India  
    and the National anthem, the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 was  
    enacted.
-   The Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act 1950 was enacted soon after  
    independence, inter alia, to prevent improper use of the National Flag and the National  
    Anthem.
-   In order to ensure that the correct usage regarding the display of the National Flag is well  
    understood, the instructions issued from time to time on the subject have been embodied  
    in Flag Code of India, which has been made available to all the State Governments, and  
    Union territory Administration (UTs).
-   There are a number of provisions in the existing criminal laws to ensure that the activities  
    which encourage enmity between different groups of people on grounds of religion, race,  
    place of birth, residence, language, etc. are adequately punished. Writings, speeches,  
    gestures, activities, exercise, drills, etc. aimed at creating a feeling of insecurity or ill-will  
    among the members of other communities, etc. have been prohibited under Section 153A  
    of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
-   Imputations and assertions prejudicial to the national integration constitute a punishable  
    offence under Section 153 B of the IPC.
-   A Communal organization can be declared unlawful association under the provisions of  
    Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967.
-   Offences related to religion are covered in Sections 295-298 of the IPC (Chapter XV).
-   Provisions of the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 (earlier the Untouchability (Offences)

```
Act 1955) “provide for punishments for offences related to caste and religion.”

## 5\. Committees and Judicial Pronouncements

### 5.1. Justice Verma Committee Report

In 1998, the Government of India set up a Committee under the Chairpersonship of Justice J.S  
Verma to work out a strategy as well as methodology of operationalizing a countrywide  
programme for teaching fundamental Duties in every educational institution as a measure of  
inservice training. The Committee made the following recommendations:

A. It sought to **optimize benefits from the existing schemes/programmes on national** Student Notes:  
**integration and communal harmony, culture and values, and environment** , by further  
activating and monitoring the work of the institutions and NGOs who are sanctioned these  
schemes by the concerned ministries of Home, Human Resource Development and  
Environment and Forests.  
B. **Towards protection and improvement of environment** , it recommended coordination  
between all the law enforcement agencies, enforcing strict compliance of the various legal  
provisions and filling legislative vacuum, if any.  
C. **Towards reorienting approaches to school curriculum** , the Committee reiterated the need  
for a fundamental transformation in the direction and approach to curricula for teaching  
Fundamental Duties in school and teacher education institutions.  
D. **In order to ensure dignity of women** , it recommended that gender biases and sex-  
stereotyping must be eliminated from all school and colleges textbooks and this should be  
given as a mandate to all curriculum development agencies, both at national and state  
levels.  
E. **Towards reorienting teacher education** , it recommended a sensitization module based on  
Fundamental Duties to be made an integral part of all teacher education programmes,  
organised by National, State and District level institutions and planning large scale teacher  
orientation programmes on this theme.  
F. **Towards incorporating Fundamental Duties in the courses and programmes of higher and  
professional education** , it suggested that the Human Rights Education Initiative of the UGC  
should be referred to as 'Human Rights and Fundamental Duties Education Initiative’ and  
the UGC may advise on incorporating Fundamental Duties as an essential component of  
their respective proposals while giving grants to Universities.  
G. **Towards the responsibilities of people's representative** , the Committee recommended  
that special efforts should be made to ensure that our legislators are aware of the  
Fundamental Duties as the same are also their duties as citizens by organizing special  
programmes at the parliamentary and state assembly levels and involving the Corporation,  
Town Area Committees and the Panchayati Raj institutions in this effort.  
H. **Towards the obligation of public administration and civil servants** , the Committee  
recommended that a module on Fundamental Duties should be adopted for inclusion in the  
Courses of different Training Institutions connected with the training of civil servants. It also  
recommended fixing responsibility of the senior public servants to project the image of  
administration as people-friendly and responsive to the problems and sufferings of the  
citizens and giving greater access to information and promoting transparency on part of the  
Government.  
I. **Towards the administration of justice** , the Committee recommended that a Judicial  
Academy should be set up to provide facilities for continuing education of Judges, to focus  
their attention on Constitutional Values and Fundamental Duties, to foster constructive  
interaction between the Bar and the Bench and to facilitate application of modern  
techniques of management to the transaction of judicial business in the Court.  
J. **Towards the role of business and industry** , the Committee recommended vigorous  
formulation and pursuit of ethical conduct for business dealings.  
K. **Towards the role of Media** , the Committee recommended that media should constantly  
educate people about Constitution and the symbols of sovereignty; harness its potential for  
rural development, empowerment of women, distance education, environmental  
protection, civic consciousness and human rights awareness; formulating a comprehensive  
media policy.

In 2003, the Supreme Court has directed the center to enact a law for the enforcement of  
fundamental duties by citizens as suggested by the Justice Verma Committee (2000).

The former Chief Justice of India, Ranganath Mishra, in a letter to the Chief Justice of India,  
requested the apex court to issue necessary directions to the State to educate its citizens in the

```

matter of fundamental duties so that a right balance emerged between rights and duties. The Student Notes:  
letter was treated as a writ petition.

National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) Report in 2002  
recommended the implementation of the Justice Verma Committee recommendations. It  
recommended that the first and foremost step that was required to be taken by the Union and  
State governments was to sensitize the people and create a general awareness of the provisions  
of fundamental duties amongst citizens.

### 5.2. Important Judicial Pronouncements

-   **Mohan Kumar Singhania & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors., (1992):** The officers in All-India  
    Services (Administrative, Forest, Police, etc.) were not taking the training seriously resulting  
    in deterioration of the services. Service Rules were amended so as to give weightage to the  
    training and penalize failure. On a challenge being laid to the constitutionality of the  
    amendment in the Rules in Mohan Kumar Singhania & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors., (1992),  
    in order to uphold the validity of the amendment, Ratnavel Pandian, J. drew strength from  
    article 51A.

```
Referring to clause (j), which commands every citizen of India to strive towards excellence in
all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher
levels of endeavour and achievement, it was held that the effort taken by the Government in
giving utmost importance to the training programme of the selectees so that this higher civil
service being the topmost service of the country is not wasted and does not become
fruitless during the training period is in consonance with the provisions of article 51A (j). The
constitutionality of the amendment was, thus, upheld.
```

-   **Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra & Ors. Vs. A State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors., (198 5 ):**  
    In Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra, Dehradun & Ors. Vs. State of U.P. & AIR 1985 SC,  
    in order to prevent imbalance to ecology and hazard of healthy environment being created  
    due to working of lime-stone quarries, the Supreme Court directed the quarries lessees  
    being cancelled and lime-stone quarries being closed down permanently. The directions  
    were issued in face of fundamental right to trade and business and the right to earn  
    livelihood.  
    Assigning paramount significance to Fundamental Duties and rather placing the  
    Fundamental Duties owing to people at large above the fundamental right of a few  
    individuals the court held that such closure would undoubtedly cause hardship, “but it is a  
    price that has to be paid for protecting and safeguarding the right of the people to live in  
    healthy environment with minimum disturbance of ecological balance and without  
    avoidable hazard to them and to their cattle, homes and agricultural land and undue  
    affectation of air, water and environment”.
-   **M.C.Mehta (II) Vs. Union of India & Ors., (1998):** In this case, article 51A containing  
    Fundamental Duties of citizens was read casting duties on the government and for issuing  
    certain directions consistently with article 51A. Directions were:  
    o the Central Government shall direct to the educational institutions throughout India to  
    teach at least for one hour in a week, lessons relating to protection and the improvement  
    of the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life in the first ten  
    classes;  
    o the Central Government shall get text books written for the said purpose and distribute  
    them to the educational institutions free of cost;  
    o the children shall be taught about the need for maintaining cleanliness and with the  
    cleanliness of the house, both inside and outside and the street in which they live;  
    o the Central Government shall consider training of teachers who teach this subject by the  
    introduction of short-term courses for such training;

o the Central Government, the Government of the States and all the Union Territories shall Student Notes:
consider desirability of organizing “Keep the city/town/village clean” week;
o to create a national awareness of the problems faced by the people by the appalling all
round deterioration of the environment.
```

-   **Vellore Citizens’ Welfare Forum Vs. Union of India, (1996):** In Vellore Citizens’ Welfare  
    Forum Vs. Union of India, (1996) 5 SCC 647 and Bandkhal and Surajkund Lakes matter, the  
    Supreme Court recognized ‘The Precautionary Principle’ and the ‘The Polluter pays’ principle  
    as essential features of ‘Sustainable Development’ and part of the environment law of the  
    country. Article 21, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duty clause (g) of article 51A were  
    relied on by the Supreme Court for spelling out a clear mandate to the State to protect and  
    improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wild life of the country. The court  
    held it mandatory for the State Government to anticipate, prevent and attack the causes of  
    environment degradation.
-   **Bijoe Emmanuel vs State of Kerala, AIR 1987:** In this case, it has been held that there is no  
    provision of law which obliges anyone to sing the National Anthem nor is it disrespectful to  
    the National Anthem if a person who stands up respectfully when the National Anthem is  
    sung does not join the singing.  
    Proper respect is shown to the National Anthem by standing up when the National Anthem  
    is sung. It will not be right to say that disrespect is shown by not joining in the singing. It was  
    observed that there was no law enacted by Parliament making it obligatory to comply with  
    article 51A(a). The Supreme Court allowed the petition filed by the children and directed the  
    authorities to re-admit the children into the school.

### 5.3. Recent Developments

-   A plea was filed before SC to direct the Central government to frame a national policy under  
    Article 51A to promote and propagate the National Anthem, the National Flag and a  
    ‘national song’. However, the court did not accept the plea. It said that Article 51A only  
    mentions National Flag and National Anthem and does not refer to a national song.  
    Moreover, **Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971** (amended in 2005)  
    prohibiting the desecration of or insult to the country's national symbols, including the  
    National Flag, The Constitution and the National Anthem is already in place.
-   Recently, the State of Karnataka proposed a new flag of the State. Apart from the  
    contentions raised regarding unity and federalism, several quarters voiced their opposition  
    to the move on the premise that it is disrespectful to national flag and hence undermines  
    Fundamental Duty.

```
However, SC in S.R. Bommai v/s Union of India case had stated that federalism is a basic
feature of the Constitution and States are supreme in their sphere. So, State flag is not
unauthorized. However, the manner in which State flag is hoisted should not dishonor the
national flag. Thus, demands to withdraw the state flag do not hold merit on the ground of
fundamental duty.
```

## 6\. Criticism of Fundamental Duties

The Fundamental Duties mentioned in Part IVA of the Constitution have been subjected to  
criticism on the basis of the following:

**a)** The list of duties is not exhaustive since some key duties are found amiss like casting vote,  
family planning etc.  
**b)** Duties as enshrined in the Constitution represent no consistent underlying theme.  
**c)** They have been criticized as being vague, ambiguous and mere moral percepts having little  
practical value due to their non-enforceable character. For instance, following the noble  
ideals of the freedom struggle, the phrase ‘composite culture’ etc.

```

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

**d)** Some critics feel that it would have been more appropriate to include duties alongside FRs Student Notes:  
since adding Fundamental Duties in a separate part of the Constitution has reduced their  
value.

## 7\. Significance of Fundamental Duties

Fundamental Duties were incorporated in the constitution through 42nd Amendment Act, 1976  
with the purpose to:

-   Promote patriotism in citizens
-   Help them to follow a code of conduct that would strengthen the nation
-   Protects its sovereignty and integrity
-   Help the State in performing its diverse duties
-   Promote ideas of harmony
-   To ensure citizens commitments towards the State
-   And to check indiscipline prevailing at that time

Despite the criticism from various corners, these fundamental duties have also proved  
significant on the following counts:

**a)** They remind citizens of their duties to the country, the society and fellow citizens while  
enjoying their rights.  
**b)** They are an important warning against anti-social activities.  
**c)** They are a formidable source of inspiration to the citizens and promote a sense of  
discipline and commitment amongst them.  
**d)** The Supreme Court has variously used these duties to assess the constitutionality of laws  
enacted by the legislature.  
**e)** Violation of fundamental duties is punishable since there are legal provisions available for  
their enforcement.

Amendment. (08/I/6a/15)

## 10\. Vision IAS GS Mains Test Series Questions

**_1\. Critically appraise the utility of fundamental duties in the Constitution of India._**

**_Approach:_**

```
Identify the important issues surrounding the utility of Fundamental Duties (FDs) in the
Constitution of India.
```

**_Answer:_**

```
Fundamental Duties were inserted in Article 51A through the 42nd Amendment Act.
The legal utility of these duties is similar to that of the DPSP. DPSP are addressed to the
state without any sanction, so are the duties addressed to the citizens without any legal
sanction for their violation.
What is right in regard to one’s self is a duty in regard to others. This way Fundamental
Rights are strengthened by the Fundamental Duties.
However, this part of the constitution contains certain weaknesses, which harm its
utilities. The duties enumerated are so vague that a number of interpretations are
available for them. For example, cherishing the ideals of freedom movement,
irrespective of the fact that the freedom movement had a number of contradictory
ideals, like revolutionary terrorism and non-violence. This raises questions on which
ones are to be cherished.
```

```
Some scholars questioned the utility of FD in a law abiding society. How can the state
ask citizens to perform some duties until the state thinks that they are not following the
law of the land?
In such a scenario, it is best that their utility be enhanced by generating awareness in
the society, as NCRCW has recommended.

**_2\. While Fundamental Rights are crucial to the survival of a vibrant democracy,_** Student Notes:  
**_Fundamental Duties are equally important. While enumerating the Fundamental_**  
**_Duties, discuss the statement._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Enumerate fundamental duties summarily.
-   Briefly make a comparison of Fundamental Rights and Fundamental Duties.
-   Discuss the importance of Fundamental Duties for a vibrant democracy.

**_Answer:_**

```
Based on the suggestions of Swaran Singh Committee, 42nd Constitutional Amendment
Act (1976) included ten Fundamental Duties in the constitution.
According to Article 51 A, it shall be the duty of every citizen of India to: abide by the
Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, National Flag and Anthem, cherish
and follow the noble ideals that inspired the national struggle for freedom, uphold and
protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India, defend the country and render
national service when called upon to do so, promote harmony and the spirit of
common brotherhood amongst the people of India, respect women, value the rich
heritage and culture, protect and improve natural environment, develop scientific
temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform, safeguard public property and
abjure violence, strive towards excellence, provide opportunities for education to
children.
Rights and duties of the citizens are correlative and inseparable. Fundamental Rights
are meant for promoting the ideal of political democracy and prevent an authoritarian
and despotic rule. It protects the liberties and freedoms of the people against the
invasion by the State. They further limit the arbitrary powers of state, and ensure some
basic inalienable rights for the development of the people. While Fundamental duties
act as reminder to citizens that while enjoying their rights, they should also be
conscious of duties towards their country, society and fellow citizens. Thus, they instill
democratic ethos by invoking duty based approach.
```

```
They serve as a warning against the anti-national and antisocial activities and serve as a
source of inspiration for the citizens and promote a sense of discipline and commitment
among them. They create a feeling that the citizens are not mere spectators but active
participants in the realisation of national goals.
In 1992, Supreme Court ruled that in determining the constitutionality of any law, if a
court finds that the law in question seeks to give effect to a fundamental duty, it may
consider such law to be reasonable in relation to Article 14 or Article 19 and save such
law from unconstitutionality.
Thus, they are equally important, if not less than fundamental rights in sustaining
democracy. They invoke and stir conscience and thus build a proactive value system in
the people unlike the reactive nature of fundamental rights.
```

**_3\. Fundamental Duties, though significant, have certain limitations. Examine._**

**_Approach:_**

-   The first part of the answer, after briefly introducing fundamental duties, should  
    focus on its importance.
-   The second part should contain the primary drawbacks which hinder its unanimous  
    acceptance.

**_Answer:_** Student Notes:

```
The fundamental duties were enshrined in the constitution via the 42nd amendment
(1976). They aim at presenting a set of obligations for every citizen of India.
```

```
Its continuance since decades speaks of its relevance. Its serves as a reminder to the
citizens that while enjoying their rights, they must be aware of their duties.
```

```
The fundamental duties have underpinned various legislative developments.
```

```
The judiciary has also several times, found consolations in the projections of the FDs.
```

```
Additionally the way of natural justice is propagated amongst the citizens.
```

```
The anti-national &anti-social activities are restrained under the umbrella of
fundamental duties.
```

```
However, there are certain inhibitions which affect its universal acceptability. They are
```

-   Primarily non justiciable, flouting of the fundamental duties doesn’t draw legal  
    action.
-   The exact nature of the fundamental duties seems to be lost amongst the vague  
    descriptions, hence its impact is narrow
-   As not many initiatives are available for creating awareness regarding its  
    importance, conscious realisation of fundamental duties is absent amongst the  
    citizens.
-   Being part of the appendage to part IV of the constitution, diminishes the merit of  
    the FDs as it lacks the importance ordained upon the FRs.

```
Inspite of the restrictions which mellow down the true essence of FDs, a developing
nation like India requires a consolidated effort to balance the rights and duties of a
citizen.
```

**_4\. The value of fundamental duties lies in establishing a democratic balance by making_**  
**_the people conscious of their duties equally as they are conscious of their rights._**  
**_Analyze._**

**Approach:**

-   Briefly describe fundamental duties and their broad features.
-   Highlight the significance of fundamental duties in establishing a democratic  
    balance.
-   Discuss the critique of the fundamental duties.
-   Conclude by suggesting a few more duties to add.

**_Answer:_**

```
The Fundamental Duties (FDs) were added in Part IV A of the Constitution of India by
the 42nd Amendment on the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee. Their
inclusion is inspired by the erstwhile USSR Constitution and the rule of jurisprudence i.e.
where there is a right there must be a corresponding duty..
```

```
Salient features of FDs
```

-   A mixture of moral liabilities (that cherish ideals of freedom struggle) and civic  
    duties (that respect the Constitution).
-   Codification of tasks, which have historically been integral to the Indian way of life.
-   Applicable for citizens only.

-   Non-justiciable. Student Notes:^  
    The Fundamental Duties maintain a democratic balance, as they are complementary to  
    Fundamental Rights which guarantee **constitutional** rights of the citizens against the  
    State and the DPSPs that impose **moral** duties upon the State. Fundamental Duties gain  
    significance, as they:
-   Remind citizens of their duties while enjoying rights – therefore help strengthen  
    democracy.
-   Serve as a warning against anti-national and anti-social elements.
-   Become source of inspiration for citizens, making them active participants in  
    realization of national goals.
-   Can be used by the courts to determine the Constitutional validity of a law.
-   Can be enforced by law of the Parliament – e.g. the Prevention of Insults to  
    National Honor Act, 1971.  
    However, their balancing role is questioned due to following reasons:
-   The list of duties is not exhaustive – important duties such as paying taxes, casting  
    vote etc. are not included.
-   Being non-justiciable, they are reduced to a code of moral precepts.
-   Some duties are vague, ambitious and difficult for the common man to understand
    -   e.g. promote scientific temper.
-   FDs should have been added after part III to keep them at par with Fundamental  
    Rights.

```
Though introduced by an amendment in the wake of emergency, the subsequent
government did not undo this change. The 86th Constitutional Amendment further
added an 11th duty. This strengthens the societal and political acceptance and approval
of having a set of duties enshrined in the Constitution. The Parliament should timely
review the scope of duties to retain their essence.

## 1\. Directive Principles of State Policy Student Notes:^

Political democracy is fragile unless the socio-economic foundation is strengthened with  
policies that aim to establish a welfare state, i.e. one that takes primary responsibilities for the  
welfare of the people, particularly those who are weak and vulnerable. It is a state that seeks to  
minimize disparities and ensure equitable development. Individual rights can be enjoyed  
meaningfully when social security and economic wellbeing is ensured.

Directive Principles of State Policy as enshrined in part IV of the constitution (Article 36 – 51)  
represent a comprehensive program of ushering in social and economic democracy in the  
country. These represent a set of principles that governments of the day – both federal and  
state must keep in mind while making state policies. Though, not justiciable, they are supposed  
to be fundamental to the governance of the country.

Notably some important rights such as right to work, social security etc that are not mentioned  
in Part III of the Constitution, find place in DPSP’s.

## 2\. Historic Evolution

The genesis of both Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles lies in our struggle for freedom  
against the British rule. Our leaders realized the importance of political and civil rights of the  
individual, as being absolutely essential for the dignity of man and development of his full  
personality. At the same time, they were conscious that in the prevailing socioeconomic  
conditions in the country, only a miniscule fraction of people would be able to enjoy these civil  
and political rights.

The only solution for making these rights meaningful to them was to engineer the material  
conditions and bring in a new social order where socio-economic justice will inform all  
institutions of public life so that the preconditions of fundamental liberties for all may be  
secured. The national leaders, therefore, laid the greatest stress on the necessity of bringing  
about socio-economic regeneration and ensuring social and economic justice.

One of the challenges that the framers of the Constitution faced while framing provisions  
relating to Fundamental Rights was to classify rights on the basis of their justiciability. In this  
regard, the Sapru committee appointed by the “All Party Conference” in 1944 submitted its  
report in 1945. Similarly, B.N. Rau, the Constitutional Advisor to the Constituent Assembly also  
recommended similar classification of the rights of an individual. The Constituent assembly  
drew from its recommendations in formulating fundamental rights and other rights in Indian  
constitution.

The committee suggested two categories of rights – justiciable and non-justiciable. The former  
are found as Fundamental Rights and other rights in the Indian constitution. The latter are  
mentioned in Part IV of the constitution as DPSP’s, which are largely in the nature of  
“instrument of instructions” to the government in making appropriate policies of socio-  
economic change.

## 3\. Influences

DPSP’s as enshrined in the Indian constitution are influenced by number of factors:

-   The idea of DPSP itself was borrowed from the Constitution of Ireland.
-   Government of India Act, 1935 contained a set of “Instrument of Instructions”.
-   The leadership of Indian freedom struggle representing liberal democratic ideas of the west  
    chose to include them in the Indian Constitution as moral guidelines for public policies of  
    the welfare state.
-   The contemporary socialist ideas also impacted the framers of the constitution. For  
    example, some DPSP’s related to worker welfare.

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com
```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   Constituent Assembly was also influenced by ideas of Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of India. Student Notes:^  
    For example – directive principles related to Panchayats, promotion of village industries etc.

## 4\. Characteristics of DPSP’s

### 4.1. Ideals to be followed by the State

These are constitutional recommendations/instructions to the State in legislative, executive and  
administrative matters that denote the ideals that the State should keep in mind while  
formulating policies and enacting laws.

### 4.2. Limitation on arbitrary exercise of power

According to Dr. Ambedkar, these are limitations on any one coming to power. It is a check  
against political majority making attempts to hijack the vision of the Constituent Assembly with  
respect to the future Indian State.

### 4.3. Non-Enforceable

According to Article 37, DPSP’s are not automatically enforceable in a court of law. They  
become enforceable only when a law giving effect to some directive principles exists. For  
example – MGNREGA for the Right to Work. However, Article 37 also holds these principles as  
being fundamental to the governance of the country and imposes a duty upon the state to  
apply these principles while making laws.

As held by Dr. Ambedkar, these cannot be considered to be mere pious declaration. If there is  
no force of law, there is political force of public opinion. No government in India can overlook  
these directions.

### 4.4. Amplification of Preamble

DPSP’s amplify values enshrined in the preamble to the Indian Constitution. For instance – it is  
DPSP’s that give meaning to the “socialist democracy” as enshrined in the Preamble. The word  
“socialist” added through the 42nd Amendment Act, was given meaning through Articles 38 and

39.  Similarly, the ideal of “Secularism” was given meaning through Article 44 – wherein the goal  
    of uniform civil code is mentioned.

### 4.5. Moral Obligation

The Directive Principles impose a moral obligation on the state authorities for their application.  
However, it is equally important to highlight that the main force behind them is political in  
nature. This is because no government in power that rests on public opinion/popular vote can  
ignore these principles while formulating policies.

## 5\. Classification and Details of Directive Principles

Though not classified in the constitution, on the basis of their content, conventionally DPSP’s  
can be classified into the following categories:

-   **Socialistic:** Reflecting the ideology of socialism, these principles provide the framework for  
    a democratic socialist state, aim at providing social and economic justice, and direct  
    towards creation of a welfare state. For instance, articles 38, 39, 39A etc.
-   **Gandhian:** Based on Gandhian ideology, these principles represent the programme of  
    reconstruction as envisioned by Gandhiji during the national movement. To fulfill the  
    dreams of Gandhiji, some of his ideas were included as Directive Principles. For instanve,  
    Article 43, 43B, 46, 47, 48.

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

-   **Liberal-intellectual:** The principles included in this category represent the ideology of Student Notes:^  
    liberalism. For instance, articles 44, 45,48,48A,49,51.
-   **International Principles:** The principles included in this category give effect to values that  
    promote internationalism and furthering and maintenance of global peace and harmony.  
    For instance, Articles 51A, 51B, 51C, 51F.

### 5.1. Article 36

#### 5.1.1. Text

Definition—In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires, “the State” has the same

India

### 5.2. Article 37

#### 5.2.1. Text

not be enforceable by any court, but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless  
fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply  
these principles in making laws.

#### 5.2.2. Description

Article 37 provides that DPSP’s will be non-justiciable i.e. they are not automatically  
enforceable in any court of law. However, their utility lies in giving directions to the State  
regarding the nature and direction of public policy. The violation of DPSP’s however, cannot be  
challenged in any Court.

### 5.3. Article 38

#### 5.3.1. Text

#### 5.5.2. Description

Article 39A directs the State to ensure that the judicial system of the country is available to all.  
The State should provide free legal aid for accomplishing the same. Notably, the union govt. has  
passed National Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 to achieve the same. It was inserted by the  
Constitution 42nd amendment act, 1976

### 5.6. Article 40

#### 5.6.1. Text

#### 5.11.2. Description Student Notes:^

The article was inserted by the 97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011. It aims to encourage  
economic activities of cooperatives which in turn contribute to the progress of rural India. It is  
expected to not only ensure autonomous and democratic functioning of cooperatives, but also

### 5.12. Article 44

#### 5.12.1. Text

Uniform civil code for the citizens—The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a  
uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.

#### 5.12.2. Description

Personal laws relate to marriage, divorce, maintenance, succession, adoption. Different  
religions in India have different personal laws. A uniform civil code would imply the same  
personal law being followed by all the people of the country.

SC has repeatedly rejected petitions seeking direction to the center to apply uniform civil code  
stating that it is a matter of policy that the court is not competent to venture in.

#### 5.12.3. Constitutional Provisions in support of Uniform Civil Code

**Article 44** under Directive Principles of State Policy: The State shall endeavor to secure for the  
citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.

**Clause (2) of Article 25** under Fundamental Rights: It empowers the State to frame any law to  
regulate or restrict “secular activity which may be associated with religious practice”

**Article 14** under Fundamental Rights: The inconsistency in personal laws has been challenged  
on the touchstone of Article 14, which ensures the right to equality. Litigants have contended  
that their right to equality is endangered by personal laws that put them at a disadvantage.

#### 5.12.4. Debate Around Uniform Civil Code

A Uniform civil code seeks to replace personal laws based on the scriptures and customs of a  
religious community with a common set of laws governing every citizen. At its core, Uniform  
Civil Code (UCC) deals with issues of secularism, equality and women’s rights. The secular  
argument is that the laws of the state should not be religion, caste or community specific.  
Further, a modern state should treat all citizens equally and should not discriminate against  
women.

In the Constituent Assembly, a UCC was supported by leaders such as Nehru, Ambedkar and  
women members but due to stringent opposition from other members, it was included only in  
the form of Directive Principles as a compromise.

The demand for UCC , however, reached its peak in the mid -80s after the Supreme Court  
verdict in the famous Shah Bano case in which SC granted her maintenance for life under  
Section 125 of the Cr.P.C.

In October 2015, A Supreme Court bench questioned the government about its mandate on  
framing the Uniform Civil Code so that unvarying standards are ushered in and all religions are  
regulated by the same yardsticks in matters of law.

#### 5.12.5. Recent Supreme Court judgments

**1.** SC held that fatwas issued by Muslim shariat courts (Dar-ul-Qazas) do not have legal  
sanctity and cannot be enforced if they infringed on the fundamental rights of an individual.  
The Bench said fatwas on rights, status and obligation of individual Muslims, in its opinion,  
would not be permissible unless asked for by the person concerned or, in cases where the  
person is unable to do it, by the person interested.

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
Personal laws ought to be administered by the regular law courts and cannot be enforced in Student Notes:
derogation of fundamental rights by religious courts that lack legal sanctity.
```

```
The judgment is a welcome step towards gradual rationalization and acclimatization of our
custom- driven and extra-legal judicial system (which often works in contradiction to our
established and widely regarded constitutional values) to the contemporary realities of a
modern democratic society — in which there is no place for any kind of gender-based
discrimination and dehumanising arbitrariness. The state can come to the rescue of an
individual if he or she is being victimised in terms of a violation of fundamental rights in the
name of Personal laws.
The Supreme Court has preserved the religious character of these Sharia courts, noting that
they do not constitute a parallel judiciary, but an “informal justice delivery system with the
objective of bringing about amicable settlement between parties.” It is important that the
Supreme Court’s intervention, at the instance of a petitioner who wanted Sharia courts to
be banned, is understood in the correct perspective.
```

**2.** In August 2017, the Supreme Court of India declared the practice of Triple Talaq or ‘talaq-e-  
biddat’ as unconstitutional. Its judgment said, “We direct, the Union of India to consider  
appropriate legislation, particularly with reference to ‘talaq-e-biddat’. We hope and expect,  
that the contemplated legislation will also take into consideration advances in Muslim

#### ‘personal law’ – ‘Shariat’, as have been corrected by legislation the world over, even by

```
theocratic Islamic States. When the British rulers in India provided succor to Muslims by
legislation, and when remedial measures have been adopted by the Muslim world, we find
no reason for an independent India, to lag behind. Measures have been adopted for other
religious denominations even in India, but not for the Muslims.”
The judgment outlines true meaning and spirit of the Quran on the anvil of individualism,
the rule of law and human rights enunciated in the constitution. This judgment is not
against any institution, organisation nor it is against the religion of Islam. It is a judgment in
favour of justice based on women’s rights as human rights.
```

#### 5.12.6. Benefits of Uniform Civil Code

-   All the laws related to marriage, inheritance, family, land etc. would be equal for all Indians.
-   It will help in improving the condition of women in India. Indian society is patriarchal and by  
    allowing old religious rules to continue to govern the family life, condemns all Indian  
    women to subjugation and mistreatment.
-   It will help the society move forward and take India towards its goal of becoming a  
    developed nation where women are treated fairly and given equal rights.
-   The various personal laws have loop holes exploited by those who have the power. Informal  
    bodies like Khap Panchayats continue to give judgments that are against our constitution.  
    Human rights are violated through honor killings and female feticide throughout our  
    country.
-   It will also help in reducing vote bank politics. If all religions are covered under the same  
    laws, the politicians will have less to offer to communities in exchange of their vote.
-   It will help in integration of India - A lot of the animosity is caused by preferential treatment  
    by the law of certain religious communities.
-   This could in time induce custodians of faith to look inwards and seek to codify and reform  
    age-old personal laws in conformity with current modernizing and integrative tendencies or  
    risk losing their flock.

#### 5.12.7. Challenges in implementing Uniform Civil Code

-   India has a strong and long history of personal laws and it cannot be given up easily.
-   A broad consensus must be drawn among different communities to facilitate such a

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
landmark step in India’s religious, social, political and most importantly judicial history. Student Notes:
```

-   The biggest obstacle in implementing the UCC, apart from obtaining a consensus, is the  
    drafting. Should UCC be a blend of all the personal laws or should it be a new law adhering  
    to the constitutional mandate? There is a lot of literature churned out on UCC but there is  
    no model law drafted.

Going forward, an evaluation survey of all communities must be conducted to suggest reforms  
within personal laws on modern and liberal lines. Communities should be convinced that UCC is  
to bring reforms not suppress them. There is a need of piecemeal reform rather than a holistic  
reform starting with what minorities are most comfortable of doing away with.

## 6\. Relation with Fundamental Rights

The Fundamental Rights and DPSP’s constitute the conscience of the Constitution. The purpose  
of FR’s is to confer on individuals the rights necessary for their development, free from coercion.  
DPSP’s are essential for a welfare society. According to Justice Chandrachud, the Constitution  
aims to bring about a synthesis between the two and together they constitute, not individually,  
the conscience of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has hence pronounced the ‘doctrine of  
harmonious construction’ to establish the relation between FR’s and DPSP’s.

The tension between FR and DPSP has been evident ever since the commencement of the  
Constitution. Initially, the comparative status of FR’s and DPSP’s was not clear. It was believed  
that they were contradictory in nature. It was in the Champakam Dorairajan case, in 1952 that  
the debate first came to the fore. A series of judicial pronouncements and constitutional  
amendments have altered the balance between the two since the commencement of the  
constitution.

**Champakam Dorairajan case (1951)** The Supreme Court held that **Article 37 expressly says that  
the directive principles are not enforceable by court**. The Supreme Court mandated that the  
chapter on Fundamental Rights in the constitution is sacrosanct and the directive principles  
have to conform to and run subsidiary to the chapter on Fundamental Rights. This means that  
**Fundamental Rights were given superiority over the Directive principles**. It also held that the  
Fundamental Rights could be amended by the Parliament by enacting constitutional  
amendment acts.

-   In **Golaknath case (1967)** however, the SC reversed its decision stating that FR’s have been  
    given a transcendental position and cannot be abridged. The doctrine of Prospective  
    Overruling was applied in the Golaknath case, whereby the SC could overrule its own  
    decision.
-   **24 th Amendment Act, 1971** was enacted to overcome the Golaknath case. It added Article  
    13(4) to the Constitution, whereby Constitutional amendment could modify a FR.
-   In the **Kesavananda Bharati case (1973)** , the SC gave the Doctrine of basic structure,  
    whereby FR’s could be abridged only to the extent that they did not form part of the basic  
    structure.
-   **42 nd Amendment Act, 1976** passed by Parliament gave precedence to DPSP’s over FR’s and  
    extended the scope of Article 31C, which provided for protection of laws implementing  
    DPSP’s 39(b), 39(c) from illegality on ground of being violative of the constitution. This  
    amendment included within the protection provided by Article 31C, any law to implement  
    any of the Directive Principles and not merely those specified in Article 39 (b) and (c).
-   In the **Minerva Mills case (1980),** the SC held that powers of the Parliament to amend the  
    Constitution are limited by the basic structure doctrine. The Supreme Court held that the  
    Constitution exists on the balance of Part III and Part IV. Giving absolute primacy to one  
    over the other will disturb the harmony of the Constitution. This took the Article 31(C) to its  
    prior condition that “a law would be protected by article 31C only if it has been made to  
    implement the directive in article 39(b) and (c) and not any of the articles included in Part  
    IV”.
-   Thus, the final status of FR’s and DPSP’s with respect to each other is following:  
    o They form an integrated scheme  
    o They are not supplementary but complementary in nature

o Together they provide the basis for inclusive democracy in India Student Notes:
o Supreme Court has pronounced the doctrine of Harmonious Construction
o FR’s have a superior legal status but it doesn’t undermine the importance of DPSP’s
o Over a period of time by using the doctrine of “liberal interpretation” Supreme Court
has included number of directive principles under Article 21.
o To examine the validity of a particular law giving effect to directive principles which
abridge FR’s, SC applies the doctrine of –
▪ Basic Structure and
▪ The Golden Triangle of rights – Article 14, 19, and 21.
```

**Doctrine of Harmonious Construction**

This doctrine is used to avoid any inconsistency and repugnancy within a section or between a  
section and other parts of a statute. The rule follows a very simple premise that every statute  
has a purpose and intent as per law, and should be read as a whole. The interpretation which is  
consistent with all the provisions and makes the enactment consistent shall prevail. The  
doctrine follows a settled rule that an interpretation that results in injustice, hardship,  
inconvenience, and anomaly should be avoided. The interpretation with the closest conformity  
to justice must be picked.

The Supreme Court laid down 5 main principles of the ‘Doctrine of Harmonious Construction’-

1.  The courts must avoid a ‘head of clash’ of contradictory provisions and they must construe  
    the contradictory provisions so as to harmonize them.
2.  When it is not possible to completely reconcile the differences in contradictory provisions,  
    the court must interpret them in such a way so as to give effect to both provisions as much  
    as possible.
3.  Courts must keep in mind that the interpretation which reduces one provision to a useless  
    standing is against the essence of ‘Harmonious Construction’.
4.  To harmonize the provisions is not to render them fruitless or destroy any statutory  
    provision.
5.  The provision of one section cannot be used to render useless the other provision, unless  
    the court, despite all its efforts, finds a way to reconcile the differences.

## 7\. Difference between Directive Principles of State Policy

## and Fundamental Rights

According to B.N. Rau, legal advisors to the constituent assembly, FR’s and DPSP’s are integrated  
in scheme. They were presented as a single scheme in constituent assembly. Even in Motilal  
Nehru report they formed one unit. It is for avoiding constitutional crisis – inability to enforce  
DPSP’s because of lack of resources, that they have been separated. The following table  
highlights the important differences between the two:

## 8\. Implementation of Directive Principles of State Policy

Since the commencement of the constitution, there have been substantial legislations to  
implement the DPSP’s. Some of those are listed below –

-   First constitutional amendment was for implementing land reforms. It was followed by 4th,  
    17 th, 25th, 42nd, and 44th amendment acts (Article 39).
-   The 73rd amendment to the constitution was done in pursuit of implementing the article 40.
-   Right to work has been made a legal right under MGNREGA. National Social Assistance  
    Program of government of India is another step in implementing the directives under  
    Article 41.
-   The Minimum Wages Act (1948), Child Labour Prohibition and Regulation Act (1986) etc.  
    seeks to protect the interests of the workers. Similarly the Maternity Benefit Act (1961) and  
    Equal Remuneration Act (1976) have been implemented to protect the interests of women  
    workers. Handloom Board, Handicrafts Board, Coir Board, Silk Board have been set up for  
    the development of cottage industries. These are some steps towards implementation of  
    Article 42 and 43.
-   86 th amendment act 2002 makes provisions for early childhood care and education (Article  
    45).
-   The policy of preferential treatment to weaker sections including women, SCs, STs, OBCs,  
    has been a consistent plank of the government welfare policies. One important step in this  
    regard has been implementation of Mandal Commission’s recommendation in pursuit of  
    Article 46. The 93rd Amendment Act 2006 is another step in the same direction.
-   Integrated Rural Development Programme (1978), Jawahar Rozgar Yojana (1989),  
    Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (1999), Sampoorna Gram Rozgar Yojana (2001),  
    Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programmes (2006) etc have been  
    implemented to improve the living standard of the people.
-   Regarding Article 48, the green revolution and the research in biotechnology are aimed at  
    modernizing agriculture and animal husbandry, among other things.
-   The National Forest Policy (1988) aims at the protection, conservation and development of  
    forests. The Environment Protection Act, 1986; The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972; are also  
    some important steps towards fulfilling directives under Article 48A.
-   The Archaeological Survey of India is charged with the work of protection of the  
    monuments like Taj Mahal.
-   Separation of judiciary from executive has been completed by amending the CrPC, in 1973.
-   The efforts of India to secure international peace are many like participating in the  
    peacekeeping missions through the UN. India also pioneered the Non-Aligned movement to  
    defuse cold war after the Second World War.

## 9\. Directives and Constitutional Amendments

Since the Indian constitution came into force, there have been number of amendments –  
addition, and modification from the part IV of the constitution.

```
Affected Article Change Through
38 (2) Added 44 th Amendment Act, 1978
39 (f) Added 42 th Amendment Act, 1976
39 A Added 42 th Amendment Act, 1976
43 A Added 42 th Amendment Act, 1976
43 B Added 97 th Amendment Act, 2011
45 Modified Text* 86 th Amendment Act, 2002
48 A Added 42 nd Amendment Act, 1976
```

\*Article 45 which originally stated:

_“The State shall endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years from the commencement of  
this Constitution, for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age  
of fourteen years”_

was substituted by

“The State shall endeavor to provide early childhood care and education for all children until  
they complete the age of six years.”

## 10\. Reasons behind Directive Principles being made non-

## justiciable and legally non-enforceable

The framers of the Constitution made the Directive Principles non-justiciable and legally non-  
enforceable because of the following reasons:

**a)** The country did not possess sufficient financial resources to implement them.  
**b)** The presence of vast diversity and backwardness in the country would stand in the way of  
their implementation.  
**c)** The newly born independent Indian State with its many preoccupations might be crushed  
under the burden unless it was free to decide the order, the time, the place and the mode  
of fulfilling them.

The Constitution makers, therefore, taking a pragmatic view, refrained from giving teeth to  
these principles. They believed more in an awakened public opinion rather than in court  
procedures as the ultimate sanction for the fulfillment of these principles.

## 11\. Criticism of DPSP’s

**a)** Critics point out the lack of consistency in the DPSP’s. Apparently greatly important  
directives have been mixed with seemingly less important ones. Further, they have not  
been arranged in a logical manner based on a consistent philosophy. According to N.  
Srinivasan, ‘the Directives are neither properly classified nor logically arranged. The  
declaration mixes up relatively unimportant issues with the most vital economic and social  
questions. It combines rather incongruously the modern with the old and provisions  
suggested by the reason and science with provisions based purely on sentiment and  
prejudice’.  
**b)** Also, their non-enforceable nature leaves their implementation on the discretion of the  
government of the day.

```
danishmanhas23@gmail.com

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

**c)** They have been criticized as a dustbin of sentiments – as they contain merely the vision of Student Notes:  
constitution makers without any instrumentalities to achieve it  
**d)** It has been argued that since the Constitution is the basic law of the land, it should not  
contain anything, which is non-justiciable.  
**e)** Also, they have been criticized on the ground that they disturb the federal structure –  
directives are instructions to both union and state governments. Much of the directives  
deal with those subjects, which come under state list. K. Santhanam has pointed out that  
the Directives lead to a constitutional conflict:

-   Between the Centre and the States
-   Between the President and the Prime Minister, and
-   Between the Governor and the Chief Minister

According to him, the Centre can give directions to the states with regard to the  
implementation of these principles, and in case of non-compliance, can dismiss the state  
government. Similarly, when the Prime Minister gets a bill (which violates the Directive  
Principles) passed by the Parliament, the President may reject the bill on the ground that these  
principles are fundamental to the governance of the country and hence, the ministry has no  
right to ignore them. The same constitutional conflict may occur between the governor and the  
chief minister at the state level.

## 12\. Significance of DPSP’s

The DPSP’s aim to establish an India where the ideals of not only political democracy, but also  
social and economic democracy have been realized. They provide a broad direction to the ruling  
regime regardless of its political complexion and hence help in maintaining some consistency in  
policy direction despite change in governments. DPSP’s have also functioned as beacons to the  
judiciary. Above all, they have an educative value.

According to M C Setalvad, the former Attorney General of India, the Directive Principles,  
although confer no legal rights and creates no legal remedies, are significant and useful in the  
following ways:

**a)** They are like an ‘Instrument of Instructions’ or general recommendations addressed to all  
authorities in the Indian Union. They remind them of the basic principles of the new social  
and economic order, which the Constitution aims at building.  
**b)** They have served as useful beacon-lights to the courts. They have helped the courts in  
exercising their power of judicial review, that is, the power to determine the constitutional  
validity of a law.  
**c)** They form the dominating background to all State action, legislative or executive and also a  
guide to the courts in some respects.  
**d)** They amplify the Preamble, which solemnly resolves to secure to all citizens of India justice,  
liberty, equality and fraternity.  
**e)** They facilitate stability and continuity in domestic and foreign policies in political, economic  
and social spheres in spite of the changes of the party in power.  
**f)** They are supplementary to the fundamental rights of the citizens. They are intended to fill  
in the vacuum in Part III by providing for social and economic rights.  
**g)** Their implementation creates a favourable atmosphere for the full and proper enjoyment of  
the fundamental rights by the citizens. Political democracy, without economic democracy,  
has no meaning.  
**h)** They enable the opposition to exercise influence and control over the operations of the  
government. The Opposition can blame the ruling party on the ground that its activities are  
opposed to the Directives.  
**i)** They serve as a crucial test for the performance of the government. The people can  
examine the policies and programmes of the government in the light of these constitutional  
declarations.

**j)** They serve as a common political manifesto. A ruling party, irrespective of its political Student Notes:  
ideology, has to recognize the fact that these principles are intended to be its guide,  
philosopher and friend in its legislative and executive acts.

## 14\. Vision IAS GS Mains Test Series Questions

**_1\. How can Directive Principles be seen as both complementary and supplementary to_**  
**_Fundamental Rights?_**

**_Approach:_**

-   First discuss the nature of both FR and DPSP briefly.
-   Thereafter analyze whether FR and DPSP are indeed both complementary and  
    supplementary to each other or not.
-   Support the answer with the help of suitable examples.

**_Answer:_**

```
The emphasis in the entire scheme of the Constitution under the headings of the
Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principle is on building an egalitarian society and
on the concept of socio-economic justice. However, there are some basic differences
between the fundamental rights and the directives.
```

-   The fundamental rights contained in Part III deal with justice in its dimensions as  
    individual, political and civil rights, while directive principles contained in Part IV,  
    spell out justice at the social level and deal with social and economic progress.
-   Fundamental rights operate as a source of restriction on the powers of the ‘State’.  
    The powers of the state are subject to those rights. Directive principles, on the  
    other hand, are incorporated in the Constitution to guide the State in matters of  
    legislation and administration. They can be treated as provisions that streamline  
    the legislative and administrative activities of the State.  
    Thus Fundamental rights and directive principles represent the negative and positive  
    aspects of State obligations. As a sequel to such a difference, the Constitution also  
    provides that the fundamental rights are enforceable through courts of law while the  
    directive principles are outside the pale of judicial enforcement. In short, fundamental  
    rights and directive principles differ in colour, content and character.

```
In spite of all these differences between them, there is a common thread running
through fundamental rights and directive principles. They have a common origin and
share common objectives i.e. ‘to ensure the welfare of the society envisaged by the
Preamble. lt cannot be disputed that both strive for justice. Directive Principles deal
with the concept of justice at macro level while fundamental rights lay down the

```

#### DELHI JAIPUR PUNE HYDERABAD AHMEDABAD LUCKNOW CHANDIGARH

```
concept at micro level. Further, directive principles form the distributive aspect of Student Notes:
justice while fundamental rights constitute its corrective aspect .Thus both complement
each other.
Mostly, directive principles have been used to broaden and to give depth to some
fundamental rights and to imply some more rights therein for the people over and what
are expressly stated in the fundamental rights. For instance by reading article 21 with
the directive principles, the Supreme Court has expanded the horizon of article 21 and
derived there from different rights of the citizen. Some of them are;
```

-   Right to life includes the right to enjoy pollution free water, air and environments.  
    The court has derived this right by reading article 21 with article 48A.
-   Right to education under article 21A is to be understood with reference to directive  
    principles contained in article 41 and 45.  
    Thus both fundamental right and Directive Principle aim at the same goal of bringing  
    about a social revolution of a welfare state and complement and supplement each  
    other towards this goal.  
    **_2\. “The Directive Principles of State Policy are socialistic in their direction and content."  
    Examine._**

**_Approach:_**

```
Discuss how the directive principles act as a guiding light in public policy formulation
and reflect the socialistic principles. The answer need not discuss socialism or its
characteristics or a general discussion on directive principles.
```

**_Answer:_**

```
Though the word socialism is vague, Supreme Court of India has observed that its
principal aim is to eliminate inequality of income and to provide a decent standard of
life to the people.
Directive Principles embody the object of the state to be a ‘welfare state’. Most of the
Directives aim at the establishment of social and economic democracy which is pledged
for in the Preamble.
Art. 38(1) provides that the State shall promote the welfare of the people by securing
and protecting as it may a social order in which justice – social, economic, and political
shall inform all the institutions of national life. Art.38(2) provides that the State shall
strive to minimize the inequalities in income and try to eliminate inequalities in status,
facilities and opportunities among individuals and groups engaged in different
vocations within the country.
Art. 39A has been inserted to enjoin the state to provide free legal aid to the poor and
to take suitable steps to ensure equal justice to all. Other articles direct the state to
ensure the participation of workers in the management of industry. There are other
provisions like right to adequate means of livelihood, right against economic
exploitation and right to human conditions of work which clearly establish the
socialistic orientation of the Directive principles of State Policy.
Though these directives are not enforceable by courts, yet these principles have been
declared to be fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of
the state to apply these principles in making laws.

**_3\. “The sanction behind Directive Principles of State Policy is in fact political”. Explain._** Student Notes:  
**_How has the issue of priority in case of conflict between the provisions of Part III and_**  
**_IV of the Constitution evolved over the years?_**

**_Approach:_**

-   Introduction should highlight the position of DPSP in constitutional scheme of  
    things.
-   Explain the political sanction in light of the non-justiciability of these and their role  
    in guiding the government policies.
-   Last part of the answer should clarify the question of priority based on judicial  
    pronouncements over the years.
-   Conclude by stressing on the importance of DPSP.

**_Answer:_**

```
Unlike the Fundamental Right the Directive Principles contained in Articles 36-51, Part
IV of the Indian constitution are not legally enforceable. Nonetheless, they have been
deemed “fundamental in the Governance of the Country”. Article 37 enjoins that it is
the duty of the state to apply these principles in making laws. Thus, it has been argued
that the sanction behind these principles is political rather than juridical for “if any
government ignore them, they will certainly have to answer for them before the
electorate at the election time”, as argued by Dr Ambedkar.
It has been noted that declarations made in Part IV of the constitution are in many
cases wider in import than the declarations made in Part III of the constitution i.e. the
Fundamental Rights. In this context the question of priority in case of conflict between
these two classes of provisions is pertinent. The DPSP have, through important
constitutional amendments (25th, 42nd etc.), become the benchmark to insulate
legislation enacted to achieve social objectives. The present position is that only Article
39 (b) and Article 39 (c) can be given precedence over Article 14, 19 and not all the
Directive Principles.
```

-   In this context, the Supreme Court first in State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan  
    (1951) case, observed, “The directive principles have to conform to and run  
    subsidiary to the chapter on fundamental rights.”
-   In Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973) the court observed that: “In building up a just  
    social order it is sometimes imperative that the fundamental rights should be  
    subordinated to directive principles.”
-   In State of Kerala V/S N.M. Thomas Case (1976) the court held that the  
    fundamental rights and DPSP are complementary, “neither part being superior to  
    the other,”.
-   In the Minerva Mills Case (1980) the court observed that “Fundamental rights are  
    not an end in them but are ... means to an end”. These ends are identified by the  
    Directive Principles.  
    The DPSP are seen as aids to interpret the Constitution, and more specifically to provide  
    the basis, scope and extent of the content of a fundamental right. In this sense both  
    have been deemed to be complementary and supplementary to each other.

    to be very critical of the process. Rather, the focus should shift towards the  
    progress and finally Suggestions to overcome the lacunae.
-   Conclude with summing up the whole situation.

The Directive Principles of State Policy, although non-justiciable, lays down the
principles, which are considered fundamental in the governance of the country, making
it the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws to establish a just
society in the country. The DPSP draws its power from multiple sources (Irish
Constitution) including Gandhian principles and the constitution framers enshrined
many principles in order to establish a new social order in which justice – social,
economic and political shall prevail.
```

```
Implementation of DPSP
Socio-economic principles
```

-   Land reforms and abolition of Zamindari System.
-   National Commission for the Welfare of Women has been established.
-   Ceiling has been placed on land and property to fix the limit of person’s holdings.
-   The rules require that both men and women be paid equal wages for equal work.
-   Schemes like MGNREGA (Right to work), SABLA, ICDS, National Social Assistance,  
    Mid-day meal etc. are examples of state attempt to follow the principles embodied  
    in the articles 39,41.

```
Gandhian Principles
```

-   Through 73rd and 74thAmendments to the constitution, (1991 & 1992 respectively),  
    Panchayati Raj has been given the constitutional status with more powers. (Article
    
-   Sincere efforts have been made for the upliftment of the SCs ,STs and of other  
    Backward Classes.  
    **International Principles**
-   India has also been actively co-operating with the U.N. to promote international  
    peace and security. (Article 51)  
    The above steps on the part of the central and state governments indicate that many  
    Directive Principles of State Policy have been implemented. However, still there is a  
    long way to go to achieve all of them in full. For instance:-
-   The concentration of wealth has increased. (India’s top 1% holds close to half of the  
    country’s total wealth, Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Databook 2014).

-   Although the school enrollment has almost reached universal, the high dropout Student Notes:^  
    rate (60 lakh students are out of school with 77 percent in rural areas) and quality  
    of education remains an area of concern.
-   PRI suffers from the lacunae of Funds, Functions and Functionaries.
-   Women labour force participation rate have come down to 32 percent (ILO global  
    employment trends report 2013).  
    There are many hindrances in the non-implementation of Directive Principles of State  
    Policy.  
    The main reasons are:
-   Limited material resources.
-   Lack of political will,
-   Lack of awareness and organized action on the part of the people.

```
Though much has been achieved but still there is a long way to go to accomplish this
objective of a welfare state. The DPSP have long shaped the policy making in India and
will continue to do so, as the principles enshrined are fundamental in nature. The
recent enactment of right to education, Housing for All scheme, Mission Indradhanush
etc. showcase the vigils of the state to abide by the DPSP.

**_5\. Directive Principles can be considered as even more important than the Fundamental_**  
**_Rights because they provide a positive thrust towards welfare. Examine._**

**_Approach:_**

-   In the introduction, briefly write about the significance of Directive Principles and  
    Fundamental Rights.
-   Highlight the importance of directive principles.
-   Also, bring out the importance of Fundamental Rights in democracy.
-   Provide a balanced conclusion.

**_Answer:_**

In the words of Granville Austin, ‘Directive Principles (DPs) and Fundamental Rights (FRs)
are the conscience of the Indian Constitution.’ While FRs ensure minimum basic rights
to ensure a dignified life to citizens, DPs are considered fundamental in the governance
of the country as it seeks to establish economic and social democracy.
In the Kesavananda Bharati Case, 1973 the Supreme Court highlighted the importance
of Directive Principles as:
```

-   They contain the basic philosophy of the Constitution which needs to be reflected  
    in the government policies and laws made by the Parliament.
-   Unlike Fundamental Rights, these principles do not put any limitations on the  
    powers of the state.
-   It covers almost every section of society. For example – children, women, old age,  
    disabled, scheduled caste and scheduled tribes, and therefore helps in the  
    establishment of a welfare state.
-   It also provides a list of areas of governance to be considered. For example - free  
    legal aid, workers participation, and equal pay for equal work, environment  
    protection and uniform civil code.

```
However, the Supreme Court in Minerva Mills case , 1980 held that absolute primacy to
one over other disturbs the harmony of the Indian Constitution. The role of the
fundamental rights is also crucial as they:

-   Are essential for holistic development of individuals as it provides necessary Student Notes:^  
    conditions for material and moral protection of man. For e.g. right to freedom of  
    religion, right against exploitation etc.
-   Help in the establishment of the rule of law. For e.g. right to constitutional  
    remedies.
-   Serve as formidable bulwark of individual liberty. For e.g. right to life and personal  
    liberty (article 21).
-   Protect the interests of minorities and weaker sections of society (article 29 to 31).
-   Act as limitations on the executive and the legislature and prevent it from  
    becoming autocratic.
-   Unlike DPs which have moral and political sanctions, the FRs are justiciable and do  
    not require any legislation for their implementation.

```
Hence, both have similar objectives and a balance between the two is necessary to
realize the vision of a welfare state and in pursuance of this the Supreme Court also
held that it is the balance between DPSPs and FRs that constitutes the basic structure
and not any one of them separately.

**_6\. Directive Principles of State Policy, though not legally enforceable in a court of law,_**  
**_are perceived as 'conscience of the Constitution’ and are fundamental to governance_**  
**_of the country. Comment._**

**_Approach:_**

-   Introduce in brief the rationale behind DPSP, and its criticism of being non-  
    justiciable.
-   List provisions that make them ‘fundamental’ for good governance.
-   Enumerate some legislation that operationalized DPSP to highlight their relevance.

**_Answer:_**

```
The Directive Principles of State Policy (Art 36-51) are ‘novel features’ of Indian
Constitution which advance socio-economic rights to citizens. They are labeled as the
conscience of the Constitution because they are recommendations from the
constitutional makers to future lawmakers and administrators for good governance.
DPSP were however made non-justiciable because of lack of financial resources and
state capacity for their implementation just after independence.
Article 37 states that they are ‘fundamental in the governance of the country and it
shall be the duty of the state to apply them.’ This is because they –
```

-   Promote the ideal of **welfare state** – to achieve justice, liberty, equality and  
    fraternity as outlined in the Preamble.
-   Supplementary to fundamental rights (political rights) – as they create a conducive  
    environment for enjoying these rights.
-   Serve as **beacons** for executive, legislature and judiciary to fulfill the constitutional  
    vision of socio-economic justice.
-   Serve as **litmus test** – for citizens to gauge the performance of any government.  
    Their significance in governance is evident from the following laws that were enacted to  
    operationalize some of these principles -
-   Right to free legal aid (Article 39 A) – Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987
-   Organization of panchayats (Article 42) – 72 nd and 73rd Constitutional Amendment  
    Act.

-   Right to work and public assistance (Article 41) – Minimum Wages Act, Old age and Student Notes:^  
    disability pension, etc.
-   Just and humane conditions of work (Article 42) – Maternity Benefit Act
-   Early childhood care and education (Article 45)– National Food Security Act, Right  
    to Education
-   Promotion of interest of backward classes (Article 46) – policy of affirmative action,  
    National Commission for SC and ST (Article 338 and 338A)
-   Separation of Judiciary from Executive (Article 50) – Criminal procedure code, 1973  
    The judiciary has also recognized the **primacy of Article 39 (b) and (c)** over certain  
    fundamental rights. Though non-justiciable, a government that rests on popular vote  
    can hardly ignore the DPSP while shaping its policy and will have to answer before the  
    electorate. Hence, awakened public opinion (and not judicial proceedings) is the key to  
    fulfilling these principles.
