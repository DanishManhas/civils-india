## Suggestion to deal with the Pakistan Challenge
#international-relations 
- Need **clarity of goal** vis-Ã -vis option of Peace or enmity with Pakistan
- India Pakistan relations follow the vicious **dialogue disruption dialogue cycle** because of vested interests, owing their very existence to conflict, them being:
	1. Deep state of Pakistan
	2. Non-state actors
### Option of enmity
- Pakistan being a [[Failed State]], more precisely a [[Rogue state]], enimosity with it is full of risk.
- Stopping the flow of Indus River as under [[Indus Water Treaty]] is neither practical, nor possible.
- Withdrawal of **most favoured nation** status hasn't impacted the economy of Pakistan much.
- **Isolating Pakistan internationally**:
	- Easier said than done
	- China is a close ally to Pakistan
	- Russia is warming up to it
	- Withdrawal of the USA from Afghanistan has given Pakistan greater influence there and in the central Asian region
	- Pakistan's location near Iran, China, Central Asia and the Indian Ocean region makes it  a **Pivot state** in international Politics
### Option of peace with Pakistan, not a choice but a compulsion( you can change your friends but not your neighbours)
- On the other hand, the more GOI engages with Pakistan, the more vulnerable it becomes to terrorist attacks.
### A multipronged strategy is required
1. pursue **back channel diplomacy** (away from media glare)
2. improve relations with countries having leverage over Pakistan like the UAE, Saudi Arabia etc
3. Develop international community's stake in India's economy to hedge against terror attacks
4. try to get **comprehensive convention agianst intertnational terrorism** concluded at the earliest.
5. Domestically, maintain the **spirit of India**. India's composite secular culture is its greatest asset against all external aggression/terrorism
