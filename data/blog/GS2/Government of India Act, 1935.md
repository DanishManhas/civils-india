### Government of India Act, 1935
#### Simon Commission
- Dissatisfaction with the act of 1919 led to demand for more reforms
- Such protests ended up in the Non Cooperation Moverment leading the British Government to appoint in 1927, a Statutory Commission as envisaged in the act of 1919, to inquire into and report on the working of the act and in 1929, announce that domininion status was the goal of Indian political development
- The Commision, headed by the Sir John Simon, presented it's report in 1930
- The report was considered by a Round Table Conference, consisting of the delegates of the British Government and of British India and as well as the rulers of Indian States
- A White Paper developed as a result of this conference , was examined by a Joint Select Committee of the British Parliament and a new Government of India Bill was drafted according to the recommendations of this Committee
