# HEP power projects in Nepal
#international-relations #seedling  #Nepal 
Nepal's hydroelectric power generation potential is 83000 megawatts, of which 40000MW is feasible at the current level of technology. However, at present, the HEP production is limited to 800 MW as a consequence of which Nepal suffers from 14 to 16 hours of power cut every day.
Despite this, Nepal is reluctant to work with India on hydroelectricity generation.
## Nepal's concerns
- Nepal alleges that India plans large scale dams, which are geologically, and ecologically unsustainable
- India insists that Nepal should give India primacy over the development of HEP projects in line with the 1953 treaty. Nepal, on the other hand, wants to issue open tenders to the other countries to bid on the project to aid in better price discovery.
## Steps taken by GOI
 Under NDA 1, India and Nepal have gone under power trading agreement. It emphasises on joint investment in infrastructure and joint marketing.
	Modi's mantra for Nepal is   **HIT**. It stands for highways, information gateways and transmission lines.
