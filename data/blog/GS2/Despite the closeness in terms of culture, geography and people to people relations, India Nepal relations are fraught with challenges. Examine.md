# Despite the closeness in terms of culture, geography and people to people relations, India Nepal relations are fraught with challenges. Examine
#international-relations #seedling  #Nepal #question


1. **India doesn't have an independent Nepal policy**. Its Nepal policy is a subset of its China policy. It is so because of India's deep-seated insecurity vis-a-vis China
		Even India's first prime minister J. L. Nehru, who articulated the principle so Panjsheel and emphasized on national sovereignty had no hesitation to declare in Indian parliament in Dec, 1950
	> India's security would enjoy priority over Nepal's sovereignty

	India can't accept the policy of equidistance of Nepal. It should have relatively close relations with India. Thus, India has sought to *micromanage affairs* in Nepal
2. **Nepali elites** have for long sought to take advantage of Nepal's unique location between the two Asian giants - the elephant and the dragon 

## Other reasons
3. **Political instability in Nepal has also been a factor because of which India couldn't develop a coherent Nepal policy**. There have been 4 formal and two interim constitutions in Nepal. The polity of Nepal has remained fragmented. Furing the 50s and 60s, Nepal's polity was fragmented across three pillars - **King, Rana and the Congress**. In early 2000s, again there were three pillars - **King, Congress andf the Maoists**. As a consequence, India followed a multi-pillar policy and couldn't gain the trust of any section.
4. **Lack of professionalism in India's approach**. Most of the Indian Ambassadors to Nepal have been from the states of UP and Bihar who more often that not, have had family relations accross the border. Due to their vested interests, they failed to present a neutral perspective of the ground realities in Nepal.
5. **Rather than building democratic institutions, India has supported individuals who could serve as Indian stooges**while ignoring the grassroots leadership in Nepal and since there is deep prevalence of anti India sentiments in Nepal, these individuals could not continue in powerful positions in Nepal for long.
6. **Delay, at times failure in implementation of the promised projects** has impacted India's image in Nepal. China, on the other hand has made deep inroads , especially in **[[HEP power projects in Nepal|HEP]] sector** because of India's incompetence, for example the **West Seti [[HEP power projects in Nepal|HEP]] power plant **
7. India has **failed to respect democratic protocol** with respect to Nepal. The 1953 treaty was signed between *Nepali PM on one side and India's ambassador on the other*.
8. **Pangs of proximity**. Because of the extraordinary closeness that marks the relationship between the two, there is need for demonstrating sensitivity in dealing with Nepal.
