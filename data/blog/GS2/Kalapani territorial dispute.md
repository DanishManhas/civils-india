# Kalapani territorial dispute
#international-relations #seedling  #Nepal 

Kalapani is a triangular land on the trijunction of India, Nepal and China. It is a disputed territory between India and Nepal.
According to the **treaty of Sagauli**, river Kali forms Nepal's western border with India. India contests that the origin point of river Kali lies below the tip of Kalapani, while Nepal argues that the origin of river Kali should include its tributary, river Lipugard. According to Nepal's contestation, Kalapani should be a part of Nepal's territory.
Since 1962, India has established a military post on it and thus the territory is strategically important for India.
## Way forward
In line with the [[Gujral Doctrine]], India should accept Kalapani as Nepal's territory. However, given the strategic importance of Kalapani to India, it should permanently lease it out from Nepal
