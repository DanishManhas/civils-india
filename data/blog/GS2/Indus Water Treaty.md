# Indus Water Treaty
#international-relations 
## Importance
- Pakistan often faces water scarcity, power shortage and repeated droughts
- As a response to repeated terrorist attacks, India sought to threaten this treaty as an instrument of war against Pakistan.
## Provisions of the treaty
- divides the Indus River system between the two countries.
- The three western rivers to be under Pakistan's control and three eastern rivers to be under the exclusive control of India
- **80%** of Indus River system is, as a result, allocated to Pakistan.
- Brahma Chellaney once called it "a unique treaty entered by an upper riparian state" because it gives a veto to Pakistan over the Indian Projects on the western rivers while they flow through Indian territory.
## Issue:
- India can utilize the waters of the western rives for limited and non-consumptive purposes only.
- If Pakistan disputes any projects undertaken by India, they need to be cleared by [[Indus Water Commission]] and if the dispute is still not satisfactorily been resolved, **third party arbitration can be sought**. 
- For more details on how it's been used by Pakistan, see [[Securing the Indus treaty]].
