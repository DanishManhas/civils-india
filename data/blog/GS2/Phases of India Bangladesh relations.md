## Phases of India Bangladesh relations
### 1971-75
- Very good phase under **Mujeeb ur Rahman** 
- **1972:**
	- signed the **peace, friendship and cooperation treaty**
### 1975-90
- predominantly military rule except briefly democracy under **Zia ur Rahman**(founding father of BNP).
- Relations deteriorated because:
	- Bangladesh had inherited Pakistan's army and their hatred for India.
### 90s onwards
- Return of multiparty democracy in Bangladesh
- relations oscillate depending upon which party is in power in Bangladesh.
	- Unlike China, there's no bipartisan consensus as far as India Bangladesh ralations are concerned.
	- Relations improve whenever Awami league comes to power and deteriorate whenever BNP does.

	### Recent phase of the relation
	Because of three consecutive terms of victory of Awami league, India Bangladesh relations are said to have entered a **golden phase**. This has happened because:
	1. **Resolution of land and coastal boundaries**: In 1974, the two sides entered into land boundary agreemnet. However , only in 2015, the protocol to the agreement was passed by the parlianment marking the succesful implemanetation of land boundary agreement. This marks a  high point in India Bangladesh relations.
	2. **The rail and road connectivity has improved substantially**.*Padma multipurpose bridge* and *Ankhura Agartala rail link* has improved connectivity within Bangladesh and between INdia and Bangladesh. 
			Waterways are also being revived to reduce the cost of trade
	3. **Defense cooperation has seen significant progress marked by reciprocal visits by chiefs of armed forces, participation in joint exercises and training programs**. During 2017 Sheikh Haseena's visit, an MOU was signed between the two countries. India extended a $500 million line of credit for puchase of defense equipment from India. There is growing effort towards industrialization and defense cooperation.
	4. **The Awami league govt. has acted on various Indian insurgent groups having had found safe havens in Bangladesh**. It adopted the policy of zero tolerance towards such groups, resulting in arrest of the chairman of ULFA and NDFB(national democratic front of Bodoland).
	5. **Bangladesh has emerged as India's largest trading partner in South Asia** with an annual formal trade of $9 billion and an informal trade of $8-$9 billion.
	6. **New areas of cooperation are emerging.India is a key partner in Bangladesh's nuclear power program**. A tripartite agreement  between India, Bangladesh and Russia for the development of nuclear power plants has been signed.
