## Need of a Provision for Amendment
The Constitution needs to be alive to the necessity of adapting itself to realities of contemporary changes. 
## Procedure for amendment
### Changing constitutional provisions deemed ordinary legislation
- Certain provisions of the constitution can be changed with simple majority as they're not deemed constitutional amendment as under Article 368
- Such bills can be introduced in either house of the parliament and passsd with simple majority i.e. 50% of members present and voting
- These provisions are
	1. Formation of new states and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing states.
	2. Creation or abolition of legislative councils in the states. 
	3. Administration and control of scheduled areas and scheduled tribes. 
	4. The salaries and allowances of the Supreme Court and High Court judges.
	5. Laws regarding citizenship.
### Amendments under Article 368
#### By special Majority
- The constitution can only be amended by introducing such a bill in either house of the Parliament 
- This bill needs to be passed by a [[special Majority]] in each house
#### By special Majority and ratification by the States
- However for amendment to certain provisions, the bill needs to be passed by atleast half the state legislatures with simple majority before being presented to the President for his assent
- These provisions are
	1. Manner of election of the President. 
	2. Matters relating to the executive power of the Union and the states.  
	3. Representation of the States in Parliament.  
	4. Matters relating to the Supreme Court and High Courts.  
	5. Distribution of legislative powers between the union and the states.  
	6. Any list in the Seventh Schedule.  
	7. Provisions of Article 368 relating to the procedure for amendment of the Constitution.

### Powers of the President regarding Amendment Bills or lack therof
- __No power to Veto__ or withhold an amendment bill since the  24th amendment act of 1971. President's assent is then merely the date from which the act becomes operational
- President's assent not required before tabling such a bill in the parliament
- Can't call a joint session in case of deadlock between the two houses


## Criticism of Constitutional Amendment Procedure in India
### Too easy to amend
In a country like the USA , at least three fourths of the majority is required to pass an amendment bill . In India however, two thirds of the those present and voting shall suffice.
### No seperate body for amendments
The lack of a constitutional body overseeing amendments has led oftenly to amendments being made just for political purposes
### All such power vested in the central Parliament 
No such bill can be initiated in a State Legislature which takes away from the traditional theory of Federalism
### Slightly vague categorization as to what can and can't be amended and how
- There's a controversy around the question that if an amendment can be considered ultravire according to Article 13 . i.e. Can an amendment Act violate any provision of Part III of the constitution
- This has led to confrontations between the legislature and the judiciary and the creation of the Basic Structure Doctrine
### No deadline for ratification or rejection by the states
This can lead to confusion about the  tabled provisions of the constitutional document
### No joint session 
Given the importance laid on amendments in the constitution, some have criticised the procedure for not allowing joint sessions to resolve deadlocks
