Recently, through a resolution of the executive in Pakistan, it sought to federally integrate the disputed territory into Pakistan.
Again, in January 2019, Supreme Court of Pakistan passed a judgement to bring the region within its jurisdiction.
###  Stand till recently
- Pakistan had, till recently, maintained that Gilgit Baltistan is a part of UN disputed territory and the residents of the region can't be declared Pakistani citizens
- India, unlike Pakistan , through a unanimous resoulution of the Indian Parliament declared Gilgit Baltistan to be the constitutional part o India and its people to be Indian citizens
### Reason for change of approach in Pakistan
- to alleviate China's concerns with respect to CPEC passing through the disputed and unstable region
- India alleges it a measure to hide the gross human rights violations and denial of freedom to the people there.
