#international-relations #seedling  #Nepal 

## Why is China interested in Nepal
- Thousands of Tibetans live in Nepal and China seeks to check Tibetan activism there
- To counter India's influence in Nepal

## Why is Nepal interested in China?
- China's deep pockets. According to a World Bank report, Nepal needs to invest 18 billion dollars in infrastructure projects by 2020 to remove binding constraints to its economic growth.
- India's failure to deliver on the promised projects.
- To counterbalance *the big bullying brother India* and to gain negotiating leverages against it
Nepal China relation got a boost following the constitutional lock-jam and the consequent unofficial economic blockade along India Nepal borders. The growing Chinese engagement in Nepal is evident in the following:
1. Nepal and China signed a *trade and transit MOU* following the blockade along the border to end Nepal's dependency on India.
2. *An MOU to connect Kathmandu and Tibet* via a strategic railway link is a part of *the joint ambition* to build a **cross Himalayan connectivity network** of trading ports, highways, telecommunication and aviation links.
3. China is **Nepal's biggest foreign investor**. In January 2018, China started providing broadband connectivity to Nepal, which till then had been an Indian monopoly.
4. The 2017 election of the left alliance led by **PM Oli** has further boosted Nepal China relations. He had contested the election on anti India rhetoric
## India's advantage
Despite the growing closeness of Nepal and China who have described their relation as **taller than Everest**, there exist **geographical limitations of distance and terrain**. 
	For instance though the 2016 **trade and transit agreement** allows Nepal to use China's seaports, they are more than 3000 km away, restricting their utility. During Modi's recent visit to Nepal(May 2018), construction of a new railway line between Ruxol in Bihar and Kathmandu was announced. Nepal has more to gain by utilizing Indian railway system to access Indian and Bangladeshi seaports

## Steps taken by India
India has sought to counter China's hard power by projecting its soft power, emphasizing on historically close cultural, religious and people to people relations with Nepal. During Modi's recent visit, India launched a bus service from **Janakpur**(the birthplace of Goddess Sita) to **Ayodhya** connecting the **Ramayana circuit**

## What should India do?
- India should focus on project implementation and delivery/
- Following the [[Gujral Doctrine]], India should take non-reciprocative initiatives towards Nepal. It is essential to check *big power small power syndrome* that marks India Nepal relations
