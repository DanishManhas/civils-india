# Importance of Bhutan for India
#international-relations #seedling  #Bhutan 
## Trusted partnership
The treaty of perpetual peace and friendship (amended in 2007) forms the bedrock of their relation. Bhutan stands out as an exception in South Asia for never having played the China card against India
## Strategic importance
### Important for India's internal security
Bhutan was the first country to take stringent action against the Indian insurgents who had found safe havens in its territory **(Operation All Clear)**
### Bhutan acts as a buffer between India and China
Bhutan has refused to settle its border disputes with China as it would accentuate India's security concerns. The **Chumbi trijunction** of India China Bhutan is very close to the narrow **Siliguri Corridor** that connects mainland India to NER. Any settlement between Bhutan and China that alters the borders in favour of Beijing will heighten India's chicken neck dilemma and has negative bearing on India's security.
## Economic/Developmental Overlap
- The HEP cooperation between the two countries is an excellent example of **win-win diplomacy**. India helps finance the projects through a combination of aid and loans. In turn , it buys excess electricity from Bhutan at low prices.
- India is Bhutan's largest trade and development partner. It has generously contributed to Bhutan's five-year plans
